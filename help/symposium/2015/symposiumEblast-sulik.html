He is the Chief Integration Officer at PrairieCare, where he leads the organization&rsquo;s initiatives in integrating behavioral health services into primary care settings, in addition to providing clinical care as the attending child and adolescent psychiatrist in the Maple Grove Partial Hospitalization Program. Dr. Sulik, who has received numerous national honors and awards, lectures across the country on children&rsquo;s mental health issues. He will present two dynamic workshops:<strong></strong></p>
 <p><strong>Anxiety from the Inside Out</strong></p>
 <p>  Anxiety produces significant physiological concerns in both children and adults. In this interactive workshop for parents and professionals, Dr. Read Sulik will explore the &ldquo;Fight, Flight and Freeze&rdquo; response, and how chronic stress, trauma, and anxiety can lead to systemic health problems, and severe emotional and behavioral issues. Using compelling stories and real-world examples, Dr. Sulik will help participants understand anxiety and why it is easily misinterpreted and misdiagnosed.</p>
 <p><strong>Understanding Depression and How to Develop Skills Needed to Help Your Child</strong></p>
 <p>Parenting a child with mental health challenges can be incredibly difficult at times, but there are skills you can learn to help your child. In this interactive workshop, Dr. Read Sulik will help parents and professionals learn about &ldquo;The 3s&rdquo; of Depression &mdash; changes in mood, changes in sleep and energy, and changes in thinking &mdash; and the most common problems that result. Participants will learn new skills that parents can use to help their child heal, recover, and prevent recurrences of depression.</p></td>
