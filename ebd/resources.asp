Preventing Harm, an organization which serves as a resource and action center on children and the environment, released its latest report, 'In Harms Way'. The report, written by internationally renowned PhD's and MD's, is an unprecedented, comprehensive analysis of the links between a variety of common household / industrial toxins and learning/behavioral disorders in children, including ADD and autism. The report also highlights the utter failure of the nation's regulatory system to protect children.
