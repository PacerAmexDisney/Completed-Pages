	<p>Parents of children with disabilities often ask:</p>
	<ul type="disc">
		<li>Can the school send my child home before the end of the school day?</li>
		<li>Can the school district suspend my child?</li>
		<li>Can the school district expel my child?</li>
		<li>What happens to my child&rsquo;s educational services if he or she is sent home, suspended, or expelled?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This interactive guide will answer these and  many other questions. Whether your child is on an <span id="iep">Individualized Education Plan  (IEP)</span> or a <span id="504">Section 504 Plan</span>,     or if you suspect that your child has a disability  that affects his   or   her behavior at school, this guide will help you understand  the     complex disciplinary process for Minnesota public school children with      disabilities.</p>

<h2 class="nounderline">Emotional or Behavioral Disorders Program Overview</h2>

<p>
The Project for Parents of Children with Emotional or Behavioral Disorders, in its 19th year at PACER, was originally organized to assist parents and  families in understanding their rights and responsibilities in accessing educational and mental health services for their children.  At that time, state-provided services were extremely limited in nature and scope, and seldom involved families in making decisions about their children's needs.
</p>
<p>
Although the passing and implementation of the Children's Mental Health Act has improved the design and delivery of services to children with EBD living in Minnesota, there remains work to be done.  The concerted advocacy of parents is required to ensure that funding for these services meets the level of need, and that the services themselves are responsive to the needs of families.  PACER continues to be an essential resource for parents who wish to improve their advocacy skills, or who require information and assistance in  accessing services for their children with EBD.
