	 	<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It   has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making   it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at   Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure   Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through   the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the   undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33   of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by   Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of   ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem   Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section   1.10.32.</p>
	 	<p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is   reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33   from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in   their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914   translation by H. Rackham.</p>

	 	<h2>Bully Free Starts with Me</h2>
	 	<p>As a young girl, Haley Bird was diagnosed with a severe peanut   allergy. She could not touch, breathe, or be in the same room with   peanuts. As a result, she grew up knowing what she could and could not   eat. As Haley got older, things began to get more difficult. Her peers   would tease, call her names, and even wave candy in her face. Teachers   would hang-up signs in the classroom to show that no peanuts were   allowed, which made her even more of a target. When the bullying got   worse, Haley&rsquo;s parents met with her school to implement a 504 plan to   insure she was safe on school grounds. </p>
		<p>&ldquo;I always knew I was different and faced many obstacles because of   my food allergy,&rdquo; says Haley. &ldquo;However, I am fortunate that my parents   have been so supportive of the issues regarding my food allergy, as well   as my experiences being a target of bullying because of it. Â That is   why it is so important to tell someone you trust if you are being   bullied or if you witness bullying behavior.&rdquo;<br>
		</p>
		<p>For these reasons, Haley, now Miss Arkansas International 2017,   chose the platform of &ldquo;Bully Free Starts with Me.&rdquo; She is educating   young children to know where to turn if they are being bullied and to   not let the words, actions, or ignorance of others defeat them. She is   sharing this message with as many people as she can, including Arkansas   state senators, representatives, and the governor who care so much about   bully prevention. &ldquo;I am working as a voice with them,&rdquo; says Haley. </p>
		<p>&ldquo;No matter what people say to you it does not define the person   you are. Yes, I was bullied in school, but I now use my story to empower   those around me. If we all foster love, I believe that bullying will   eventually end. One word or action can change a person&rsquo;s life. Stand up   for those around you.&rdquo;</p>
