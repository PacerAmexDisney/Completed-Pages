	<h1>Sam Graves</h1>
	<p>For many people, constantly changing technology can be a major  source of irritation, but for 19-year-old Sam  
Graves, the latest innovations have been a home run. Sam, who has  cerebral palsy, is a self-professed Minnesota 
Twins fan, co-author of the baseball blog &ldquo;<a href="http://gravessack.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Two Men On</a>,&rdquo; and a  freshman at Augsburg College in Minneapolis. He is thriving at school, at home, and in the community thanks, in  part, to new assistive technology.&ldquo;I am always looking for the latest and coolest piece of  technology,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;When I&rsquo;m looking for new 
technology I usually go online to find out about it or I read  about it in the news.&rdquo;</p>
	<p>Sam was 3 years old when his parents, Kathy and Hazen Graves,  first brought their son to <a href="/stc/">PACER&rsquo;s Simon  
		Technology Center (STC)</a>. That visit was the beginning of a  fruitful relationship with PACER that has provided Sam access to new technology  as it becomes available. It also led the family to become enthusiastic PACER  volunteers.</p>
	<p>&ldquo;For a kid like Sam, technology has really leveled the playing  field,&rdquo; says Kathy. &ldquo;The iPad, for example, has  
		made such a huge difference in his life. He also has his own  website, he writes a blog, and he had a summer job  
		editing copy via technology. He is a very good writer.&rdquo;</p>
	<p>&ldquo;Sam doesn&rsquo;t just use technology, he embraces it,&rdquo; says Jonathan  Campbell, an assistive technology specialist  
		with the STC who has provided consultations for Sam at PACER.  &ldquo;When he first showed me how he uses his iPad, the conversation wasn&rsquo;t about  what the iPad could do for him, it was about how cool the iPad was. That&rsquo;s when  I knew we would get along very well!</p>
