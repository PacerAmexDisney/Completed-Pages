	<h1>Brett Nelson</h1>
	<p> Hi. My name is Brett Nelson. </p>
	<p> When I was in school, my mom and dad used PACER to help me get better  services. I graduated from Edina High School in 1999, and from VECTOR,  a transition program at Hennepin Technical College in Eden Prairie in  2003. At VECTOR I learned how to take responsibility for my life, find  a job, keep it and do good business. I have worked at Lunds in Edina  for over 7 years. On my 5 year anniversary Lunds rewarded me with a  watch with a real Lund's gold symbol on it. I really love my job. </p>
	<p> In my free time, I compete in Special Olympics bowling, basketball,  swimming and golf. I have won many medals, but for me, the fun is being  part of the team. We have practices, dances and lots of fun. It keeps  me very busy. </p>
	<p> I live in my own house that my parents helped me buy during the work  week. I have staff that stay with me overnight and help me cook, clean  and take care of the house. I have a cat, Goofy, who lives with me  also. On the weekends, I stay at my parents house. </p>
	<p> I also have a wonderful girlfriend, Leslie. She and I have been dating  for about 9 years. We met because her mom and my mom volunteered at  PACER. I took her to my Prom and we've been dating ever since. She is  fun to be with and I really love her. We go on dates almost every  weekend. PACER should start a dating service! </p>
	<p> I want to thank all the people who help PACER. Without your support I wouldn't have the opportunities I have today! </p>
