	<h1><strong>Jake</strong></h1>
	<p>Colleen  McGough-Wood sounds like a typical proud grandmother when she talks about her  grandson Jake.&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  really amazing. He&rsquo;s the happiest, sweetest, most loving guy you can imagine,&rdquo;  she says without much prompting.  &ldquo;He has the most contagious laugh in the entire world.&rdquo;</p>
	<p>Eight  years ago, however, those weren&rsquo;t the words people used to describe the  newborn. The terms were frightening: rare brain defects, septo-optic dysplasia,  schizencephaly, seizures, blind, deaf in one ear, non-responsive, unable to  eat, never walk.</p>
	<p>&ldquo;We  knew before he was born that he&rsquo;d have disabilities,&rdquo; she says, but no one knew  how those issues would affect Jake or the family. Awash in shock and confusion,  the family turned to their doctor, who told them not to give up&mdash;and to contact  PACER Center. The family did just that.</p>
	<p>&ldquo;We  got help before Jake was even here,&rdquo; Colleen says. &ldquo;The big thing PACER helped  us realize was that the		earlier  you connect with the experts and get into the <a href="/publications/earlyChildhood.asp">early intervention system</a>, the  better off your child will be.		Never  would we have thought to obtain services so early.</p>
	<p>&ldquo;PACER  gave us so many ideas, like finding a therapist to help Jake learn to eat,&rdquo; she  says. &ldquo;They gave us names 
		and  places to go. Sometimes that&rsquo;s all people need&mdash;some help to know where to  start.&rdquo;</p>
	<p>Following  PACER&rsquo;s advice, the family immediately found a therapist who taught the infant  how to suck and swallow. Thanks to that early intervention and despite those dire  initial predictions, Jake learned to eat and has never needed a feeding tube.  It was the first of many victories.</p>
	<p>With  PACER&rsquo;s help, the family identified other services and resources that would  help Jake. He has had a 
		personal  care assistant since he was born, for example. When Jake was ready to begin  school, PACER helped 
		again.  &ldquo;Some families want their child with a disability to be mainstreamed in every  class and every field trip,&rdquo; 
		Colleen  says. &ldquo;We felt differently. He&rsquo;s not going to benefit from math class or  writing class. It&rsquo;s more helpful 
		for  him to spend more time working on his speech. PACER helped us understand our  rights to ask that Jake&rsquo;s 
		special  education services fit his needs. He spends about half his time in the regular  classroom and half outside it.&rdquo;</p>
	<p>PACER  also helped the family deal with another concern. &ldquo;Jake has seizures,  especially if he doesn&rsquo;t get enough sleep,&rdquo; Colleen explains. Due to some other  disability issues, he goes to bed at 12:30 or 1 a.m., so he wakes up 
		after  a typical school day begins. The family wondered if Jake had to attend a full  school day. &ldquo;Thanks to PACER 
		digging  into it for us, we found out he can have a modified school day, with the  agreement of the Individualized 
		Education  Program team members,&rdquo; Colleen says.</p>
	<p>All  the efforts are paying off. &ldquo;Jake&rsquo;s in first grade this year, and it&rsquo;s going  well,&rdquo; Colleen says. &ldquo;He absolutely loves getting in his gait trainer for gym  class, and he loves music class. He&rsquo;s able to use a head switch to turn the  music on and off for the kids. And every other week, he either goes swimming or  bowling.&rdquo;</p>
	<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  way more functional than we expected,&rdquo; she adds. &ldquo;They told us he&rsquo;d never walk,  but he can use a gait trainer. He can&rsquo;t talk, but he can communicate. If he&rsquo;s done  eating, for example, he&rsquo;ll clench his teeth.&rdquo;</p>
	<p>Before Jake was born, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d had no exposure to disability and I&rsquo;d  never heard of PACER,&rdquo; Colleen says. Now, however, it&rsquo;s her first thought when  friends share concerns about their own children with disabilities. PACER advocates  are always there for parents, she adds. &ldquo;PACER has the ability to work with  families to help them get what they need and let them be the one to make the  decision about what&rsquo;s right for their child. If they don&rsquo;t know the answer,  they&rsquo;ll find out. If what they first propose doesn&rsquo;t work, they tell you to  call back and they&rsquo;ll explore more solutions. PACER is your full-service stop,&rdquo;  Colleen adds. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your first call and every call in between.&rdquo;</p>
