	<h1>Noah Melhorn</h1>
	<p>Noah Melhorn, 21, is a wildland firefighter battling blazes most  recently in Arizona. But for most of his life, he fought a different type of  battle with the help of his mother, Terri Fierstine. Diagnosed with dyslexia and learning disabilities  when he was in fourth grade, Noah struggled to read.</p>
	<p>&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t catching on, and I  kept wondering when he would be able to read a paragraph,&rdquo; says Terri, who now  lives in Walker, Minn. &ldquo;Both of us were frustrated.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
	<p>When special education  services during the school year didn&rsquo;t help him progress, Terri sought  additional tutoring help in the summer. She was eventually able to secure  payment for the service through the school district her son attended at that  time. Along the way, she referred to<a href="/publications/specedrights.asp"> PACER&rsquo;s information on writing  Individualized Education Programs (IEPs)</a>.<br />
	&ldquo;Through perseverance, many  meetings with teachers, numerous IEPs, phone calls, e-mails, and summer  tutoring, Noah caught up in high school,&rdquo; Terri says. </p>
	<p>In fact, Noah was on the honor  roll throughout high school and received numerous scholarships when he  graduated in 2006. After graduating from a wildland firefighting program at  Itasca Community College in Grand Rapids, Minn., Noah found work fighting fires  in Arizona and loves the challenging job, says Terri, a mother of four.</p>
	<p>Through the toughest school  years, Terri and Noah just kept trying. &ldquo;Noah always kept everything positive,&rdquo;  she says. &ldquo;He taught me a lot. He taught me to take breaks. When things were  too hard, we would shut the book and come back to it later.&rdquo; Though they took breaks, Terri and Noah didn&rsquo;t let  discouragement keep them from pressing forward.</p>
	<p>&ldquo;During challenging times,  don&rsquo;t give up,&rdquo; Terri advises. &ldquo;Instead, take a deep breath and realize that  you are your child&rsquo;s strongest advocate. Persevere for your children&rsquo;s special  needs in education. The rewards are a lifetime of happiness in seeing your  child&rsquo;s dreams become a reality and knowing you did everything you could for  them!&rdquo;</p>
