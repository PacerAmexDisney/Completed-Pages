	<h1>Jill Bateman</h1>
	<p> Christy Bateman and her daughter, Jill, who has spina bifida, first  heard of PACER in 1977. They were attending a pre-school class at  Courage Center in 1977, when someone from PACER came to talk about the  state&rsquo;s special education laws and the rights of parents and children  with disabilities. </p>
	<p> &quot;Our experience with PACER began with us getting crucial information about the new laws affecting Jill,&quot; said Christy.   &quot;But we soon realized that PACER was about so much more than just the laws.&quot; </p>
	<p>Christy said <a href="/workshops/">PACER&rsquo;s parent training workshops</a> helped her and her  husband, Ron, define their role as a member of Jill&rsquo;s education team.  &quot;We soon became very effective parent advocates for our daughter,&quot; said  Christy. Christy also noted, education and advocacy training was only  the beginning. &quot;We also found an incredible level of support from PACER  staff and the other PACER families going through similar  situations&mdash;support that has been invaluable to our family.&quot; </p>
	<p>PACER also helped Christy and Ron guide Jill through the sometimes  confusing transition period, both from school to work and from living  in their home to being on her own. Jill, now 30, currently lives  independently with a roommate and personal care attendants. At Courage  Center, she is a receptionist in the medical rehabilitation department. </p>
	<p> The family remains active supporters of PACER. Both Christy and Ron  have served as members (Christy was president) of the PACER Board of  Directors and Christy has been a puppeteer with the <a href="/puppets/">COUNT ME IN  program</a>. Jill has attended the annual PACER benefit every year. The  Bateman&rsquo;s younger daughter, Kimberly, is a family/child psychologist  with an interest in disabilities, siblings and rehab medicine. </p>
	<p> &quot;There has not been a chapter in Jill&rsquo;s journey that PACER has not been a part of for us,&quot; said Christy.   &quot;That has made all the difference in our lives. For us, PACER was the answer.&quot; </p>
