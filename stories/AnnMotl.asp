	<h1>Ann Motl</h1>
	<p>When Ann Motl signed up in 2003 for  PACER Center's first <a href="/stc/exite/">EX.I.T.E (Exploring Interests in Technology and  Engineering) Camp</a> for middle school girls with disabilities, she had no idea  that a few days of fun would change her life forever. Now 22 years old, Ann  recently graduated from college with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical  Engineering. </p>
	<p>&ldquo;Before I went to EX.I.T.E Camp I  knew that I really liked computers, and I didn't mind my math and science  classes, but the camp taught me what an engineer actually does,&rdquo; she says.  &ldquo;Seeing other people who were engineers &ndash; especially people with disabilities &ndash;  really helped me decide that it was a great career path.&rdquo;</p>
	<p>The daughter of dairy farmers Mike  Motl and Kim Harff, Ann graduated from Staples-Motley (Minn.) High School in  2008. She compiled a long list of honors and achievements along the way, and  was awarded the Board of Governors Engineering Scholarship at the University of  St. Thomas in St. Paul. </p>
	<p>Following her college graduation in 2012, Ann  completed a public policy and engineering internship in Washington, D.C.,  sponsored by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. In the fall of 2012,  she enrolled at the University of Minnesota Law School.</p>
	<p>&ldquo;I really like engineering, but I  want to be a patent attorney so I can help engineers file their patent  applications,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I want to be able to use my people skills, too, not  just sit in front of a computer working with modeling software all day. I think  it will be a really good fit for me.&rdquo;</p>
	<p>Success hasn't come easy for Ann. She  has Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), a neuromuscular disorder. She has very  limited use of her limbs and requires a power wheelchair for mobility. Like all  good engineers, however, Ann is a great problem solver and she has overcome numerous  obstacles that stood between her and her rather lofty goals. </p>
	<p>At St. Thomas, Ann lived in an  accessible dorm room, utilized classroom note takers, hired personal  care assistants, and employed various forms of assistive technology, including  voice recognition software. She praises the university's disability services staff for working diligently to understand her  requirements and meet her needs. They even helped Ann educate professors about  her unique learning style so that she could have extra time to complete exams  and assignments.<br />
		Of course there are difficult  adjustments every college freshman must make &ndash; particularly when moving from a  small high school to an urban campus &ndash; not to mention the academic challenges  involved. During her first year in St. Paul, Ann often went home from physics  class crying. </p>
	<p>&ldquo;It was a pretty steep learning  curve,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I am from a really rural area and everything was new to me.  It's crazy to think back about how much I had never experienced or didn't know.  I guess I just waded through somehow.&rdquo;</p>
	<p>Over the next four years, no matter  how high the barriers were, Ann never gave up, and she learned how to  effectively advocate for herself. She credits PACER Center for providing the  knowledge and resources that helped her secure the accommodations she needed to  be successful. The results speak for themselves.</p>
	<p>&ldquo;I decided at the end of EX.I.T.E  Camp that being an engineer would be great,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Now I have my  engineering degree, but I can do much more than that. My goals just keep  growing. Who knows where I'll end up?</p>
