	<h1><strong>Andrew Olson</strong></h1>
	<p>Ask  12-year-old Andrew Olson what his favorite subject is in school, and he&rsquo;ll  glance up from his new iPad just long enough to answer with a resounding,  &ldquo;Lunch!&rdquo; His mom, Jackie Olson, laughs and reminds him that he does enjoy  science and reading, too. </p>
	<p>As  he goes back to solving math problems with the touch of a button, she explains  that technology has helped Andrew in many areas of school. &ldquo;He actually really  likes going to school,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s an expert with computers. He&rsquo;s always  changing our screensavers and looking at education websites or YouTube videos.&rdquo;</p>
	<p>Andrew,  who&rsquo;s in sixth grade, has Joubert syndrome, a genetic disorder with outcomes  similar to cerebral 
		palsy.  He has multiple developmental delays, most of them physical. After he was  diagnosed with his 
		disability  at birth, Jackie and her husband, Geoffrey, made the decision to call PACER  Center for help.</p>
	<p>Since  then, the family has stayed in close contact with PACER and used many of its  services. As Andrew grew older, it became clear that technology, such as his  iPad, would make a significant difference in his life. He&rsquo;s benefitted greatly  in the past from consultations with PACER&rsquo;s Simon Technology Center (STC) staff  and the <a href="/stc/library/">STC Lending Library</a>, which allows families to check out adaptive  technology and equipment at no cost, much like a public library. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a  Best Buy for kids with special needs,&rdquo; Jackie says of the Lending Library.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been amazing. The staff really works with you to help you find what you  need. Technology has been a real strength for Andrew.&rdquo;</p>
	<p>PACER  has also helped Jackie learn how to become an effective parent advocate. During  Andrew&rsquo;s elementary school years, Jackie attended several workshops on  advocating for her child and received individual help from PACER advocates  concerning appropriate services for her son. When Jackie requested additional  services from the school district, she also sought advice from PACER advocate  Virginia Richardson.</p>
	<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  comforting to know that she and other advocates are there if we ever need  help,&rdquo; Jackie says. 
		With  Jackie acting as a strong advocate, elementary school went well for Andrew and  their family. When 
		Andrew  started middle school, though, it became a little tougher to collaborate with  Andrew&rsquo;s four regular education teachers, three special education teachers,  four paraprofessionals and three specialists. One of the family&rsquo;s biggest  challenges is convincing others that Andrew&rsquo;s cognitive skills are much  stronger than his physical abilities, Jackie says.</p>
	<p>But  Andrew&rsquo;s family and those close to him know better. He takes mainstream social  studies and science classes, and with new technology, such as applications on  his iPad, he&rsquo;s also improving his math and reading skills. And while he does  have physical limitations, Andrew stays very active through swimming, adaptive  skiing and baseball, where he usually plays second or third base.</p>
