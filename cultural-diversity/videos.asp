Culture is embodied in the ordinary things we do- how we speak, greet parents, organize a meeting, or provide a service. When important belief systems are breached, providers run the risk of offending the family. This presentation given by a unique panel of parents who are also advocates and experts in diversity, will suggest strategies they have found to be effective for building collaboration with families.</p></td>
