<h1 style="text-transform:none;">Parent Involvement and Engagement with Families from Diverse Communities
  Current Research Literature, 2007 to 2013
</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>  PACER Center is Minnesota&rsquo;s Parent Training and 
  Information Center federally-funded under the Individuals 
  with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). PACER has been 
  a collaborative partner with the Minneapolis and St. Paul 
  school districts, as well as the Minnesota Department of 
  Education in a 5-year State Personnel Development Grant 
  (SPDG) Parent Involvement Project. The goal of the project 
  is to improve educational results for children and youth with 
  disabilities from diverse communities, particularly Hispanic 
  and Latino, African American, Hmong and Southeast Asian, 
  and Somali families. In addition to PACER&rsquo;s multicultural 
  specialists conducting needs assessment activities with 
  school staff and parents, the project team searched 
  current research to inform the development of strategies, 
  activities, and materials to increase school staff&rsquo;s capacity 
  to meaningfully engage with families in their children&rsquo;s 
  education. </p>
  
 <h2> Scope and methodology </h2>
  <p>The search was not exhaustive and focused on research 
  conducted from 2007 to 2013 that included information 
  specific to diverse families. Search terms included “parent 
  involvement,” “parent engagement,” “family involvement,” 
  and “family engagement.” We noted a shift over time 
  to more widespread use of “engagement” rather than 
  “involvement,” and “family” or “family and community,” 
  rather than “parent.” In many cases, the terms appeared to 
  be used interchangeably with no meaningful distinction. 
  While not used consistently, more recent literature 
  purposefully delineates a difference between the terms, 
  with “involvement” describing school-generated activities 
  that parents are invited to participate in, and “engagement” 
  as the ways in which schools and parents work as more 
  equal partners in the child&rsquo;s education. The Minnesota 
  Department of Education defines family engagement as 
  “the collaboration of families, schools and communities as 
  active partners in the shared responsibilities of ensuring 
  each student&rsquo;s success in lifelong learning and development.”</p>
  <p>
  The first section includes parent involvement and 
  engagement studies that are multicultural in scope. This 
  is followed by culturally-specific research studies. We 
  found limited research specific to parents from diverse 
  communities whose children have a disability.</p>
  <p>
  We have attempted to include a representative list of 
  the research literature, particularly those studies which 
  address the interests and needs of educators, and have 
  excerpted pertinent descriptive information from the 
  abstracts or the studies themselves. Inclusion on the list is 
  not an endorsement of the particular research study or its 
  conclusions. </p>

  <p>
  This article examines a study on parent advocacy during 
  special education home–school interactions and describes 
  a variety of roles that parents and families assume when 
  advocating for their children with disabilities. The findings 
  suggest that parents&rsquo; socioeconomic, educational, and 
  linguistic backgrounds factor strongly into their decisions 
  about how to advocate for appropriate special education 
  services. Parents in the study often expressed dissatisfaction 
  with the reception that they had received in schools, and 
  their testimonies may help school-based support teams 
  and those responsible for service provision think about 
  appropriate ways of engaging families and encouraging 
  collaboration. </p>

    <p>As parents, we are not familiar with 
      parent engagement or school involvement. 
      Also, most of us, we do not attend many 
      school activities because of many reasons; 
      it could be we don&rsquo;t have as much freedom 
      as many mainstream families do; it could 
      be it is difficult for us to stay engaged 
      because of the language. However, we value 
      education and we try to help our kids at 
      home, or pay extra money for a tutor.</p>

  This article presents recommendations for ways in which 
  educators can engage culturally and linguistically diverse

  that schools often involve families to the extent mandated

  fully engage them as collaborators in the decisions about 
  the appropriate special education services for their children.

  <p>
  Parental involvement at school offers unique opportunities 
  for parents, and this school-based involvement has important 
  implications for children&rsquo;s academic and behavioral 
  outcomes. The authors used data from the Early Childhood 
  Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort (National 
  Center for Education Statistics, 2001) to examine race and 
  immigrant differences in barriers to parental involvement at 
  school. Minority immigrant parents, compared with nativeborn 
  parents, reported more barriers to participation and 
  were subsequently less likely to be involved at school. 
  Among immigrant parents, time spent in the United States 
  and English language ability were positively associated with 
  involvement, but these associations differed by race. Barriers 
  to involvement serve as another source of disadvantage for 
  immigrant parents and their children. </p>  <div class="disability-related">Disability Related Resource</div>

  This study examined the level and impact of five types

  parent educational attainment. Consistent with the theory, 
  parents with different demographic characteristics exhibited 
  different types of involvement, and the types of involvement

  strongest association with achievement. However, contrary 
  to theoretical expectations, members of dominant and nondominant

  <p>This article provides a framework for thinking about how to best plan for and facilitate positive transition outcomes for CLD youth with disabilities who come from families whose value systems differ from those of mainstream American society.  It presents a person-family interdependent approach to transition that emphasizes family empowerment, sustainability of transition services, and adaptations to the transition planning process. It makes the case that this approach may result in better long term transition outcomes for CLD youth with disabilities, as well as providing their families with greater satisfaction with the transition planning process.</p>
  <p class="journal">Kim, Kyeong-Hwa and Morningstar, Mary E. (2005). Transition Planning Involving Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Families.  Career Development for Exceptional Individuals, 28(2).</p>
  <p>Family involvement in the transition process has been recognized as a crucial indicator of successful transition planning. Unfortunately, many take a passive role in their child's Individualized Education Program (IEP) transition meeting.  Despite the clear mandate of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), parents from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds are even less involved. This article explores the current status of parent involvement in transition planning for families from diverse backgrounds. It examines the barriers parents face, and recommends strategies to enhance the partnerships between parents and school programs during the transition period.</p>

  <p>The purpose of this study was to gather in-depth information about parents' experiences in the transition planning process. 19 African American, Asian American, European American, and Hispanic parents of high school students with disabilities were interviewed about their knowledge and involvement in their children's transition planning process. Emergent themes included a lack of knowledge regarding transition planning, the importance of attending Individualized Education Program and transition meetings, the importance of employment, the importance of home support, and parental emotions as barriers.</p>

  <p>Despite growing diversity in our school systems, many legal mandates and transition components are based on European-American cultural beliefs regarding disability, optimal post-school outcomes, and how best to achieve these outcomes. These beliefs comply with mandates without considering cultural differences.  This article addresses the challenges that culturally diverse families face as they go through the transition process of their children with disabilities as well as discusses practices that will lead to more successful transition planning for these students and their families.</p>

  <p> This study sought to understand the perceptions of 
    parental involvement and parental uninvolvement at a 
    predominantly African American inner-city high school. 
    Qualitative interviews were conducted with 15 parents 
    and 10 staff at an inner-city public high school. Five major 
    themes emerged regarding the meanings of parental 
    involvement at this school: participation at school, being 
    there outside of school, communication, achieve and believe, 
    and village keepers. Results showed that some participants&rsquo; 
    perceptions of parental involvement were consistent with 
    earlier understandings of parental involvement. Results also

    and success in parental involvement. Research suggests that 
    Asian and European American students&rsquo; parents are more 
    involved in school related activities than parents of African

    are more likely to face barriers such as low socioeconomic

    one job, among other societal issues. Nonetheless, there 
    are examples of success in parental involvement amongst 
    African American students in which a combination of

  <p> Contemporary parental involvement research has produced

    with inner-city African Americans are currently limited 
    by problems of research methodology and program foci. 
    Certain research studies do, however, demonstrate that

    themes of empowerment, outreach, and indigenous 
    resources. Based on these three promising themes, the

    African American parental involvement as a means of 
    increasing parental participation and school success among

  <p> This article presents initial findings from a study that

    neighborhood conceptualized their roles in their 
    children&rsquo;s mathematics learning. Based on interviews and 
    observations focusing on 10 mothers&rsquo; involvement in their

    expands typical characterizations of parent involvement. This 
    framework privileges practices that are both traditionally 
    visible and invisible to the school, and highlights how 
    parents act as “intellectual resources” in their children&rsquo;s 
    education (Civil, Guevara, &amp; Allexsaht-Snider, 2002). 
    Findings offer evidence that traditional understandings of 
    parent involvement may overlook ways that low-income 
    parents deliberately involve themselves in their children&rsquo;s 
    education. Findings also identify challenges that these 
    parents face in relation to their children&rsquo;s mathematics

  <p>This study explores factors impacting successful transition of American Indian students with mild to moderate disabilities to postsecondary academic settings and other lifelong learning opportunities. Individual members of three Southwestern tribes were interviewed about personal factors during transition, and secondary, and postsecondary experiences.  Follow up interviews were conducted two years later. Many participants did not see themselves as active participants in the IEP process and educational placements ranged from inclusive to more traditional resource classrooms and self-contained settings. Secondary teachers and mentors offered support and encouragement to participants. Fewer participants received accommodations in postsecondary settings, and in some instances instructors lacked an understanding about ADA and ways to modify instruction. Participants highlighted the importance of family and religion in their lives throughout the transition process. Those participating in both interviews showed statistically significant positive change in self-ratings of dimensions of self-advocacy and self-determination.</p>

    a Midwestern elementary school where the Hmong student

    members are employed (three teachers and two aide/ 
    translators). Findings indicate differing opinions among 
    parents and school staff. Conflicts with work schedules 
    and language barriers are common constraints to parent 
    involvement in the classrooms. Hmong parents are deeply 
    concerned about their children&rsquo;s education and expect the 
    school staff to be accountable for student achievement. Like

  This study examines school belonging and psychosocial 
  adjustment among a sample of 76 Somali adolescents 
  resettled in the United States. A greater sense of school 
  belonging was associated with lower depression and higher 
  self-efficacy, regardless of the level of past exposure to 
  adversities. </p>

  This article presents the results of a study conducted in the 
  Twin Cities area that attempted to understand the perceptions 
  Somali parents had about their children&rsquo;s schooling and 
  their own roles in their children&rsquo;s education. The purpose 
  of the study was to determine whether differing perceptions 
  among teachers and Somali parents about Somali parent 
  involvement are rooted in cultural differences. The author 
  concludes that many recent Somali immigrants do not fully 
  understand the English language or educational norms in 
  the United States, and that cultural differences can easily 
  create misunderstandings about the degree of parental 
  support exhibited by Somali parents. The article offers 
  recommendations for both parents and schools to bridge 
  cultural differences, including using existing infrastructure 
  in the Somali community to help parents become more 
  actively involved, conducting workshops for parents to 
  disseminate information and help reduce misperceptions, 
  providing informal settings for parents and teachers to meet 
  to discuss children&rsquo;s progress, and recognizing and utilizing 
  parents&rsquo; skills by involving parents in decisions regarding 
  students&rsquo; education.</p>

    <p>My son&rsquo;s school teacher gives us an 
      opportunity to come to the school either 
      before or after school so we can meet with 
      her. It is a very good way to communicate 
      with me since I don&rsquo;t know how to use the 
      computer and reading English is difficult. </p>

    A qualitative investigation of Somali immigrant 
    perceptions of disability: Implications for genetic

  This study examined the potential utility of genetic 
  counseling services for Somali immigrants by investigating 
  their perceptions of disability. Five Somali women 
  participated in structured interviews that assessed their 
  perceptions of the nature, causes, and impact of disability, 
  and care for persons with disabilities. Using a Heideggerian 
  Hermeneutics qualitative method of analysis, six major 
  themes emerged: disability refers to both physical and 
  mental conditions, with mental disability generally thought 
  of first and as more severe; in Somalia, the family cares for 
  disabled family members, treating them as if they were 
  “normal”; there are major cultural differences between 
  Somalia and the United States in how persons with 
  disabilities are treated; caring for a person with a disability 
  is stressful for the family; Allah determines whether or not 
  a child will be disabled, and this cannot be predicted or 
  altered; and family is the primary life focus, and therefore, 
  risk of disability does not affect reproductive decisions. 
  These themes suggest that traditional genetic counseling 
  may have limited utility for Somali immigrants. This study 
  recommends several modifications to traditional genetic 
  counseling for Somali patients that also may be useful for 
  populations that have similar beliefs. </p>
