          <p>The adage, &ldquo;You never have a second chance to make  a first impression,&rdquo; applies to school professionals who  want to establish good relationships with the families  they serve. For a parent from a diverse community, the  typical challenges are often compounded by differences  in language, culture, and traditions. The first contacts  provide the opportunity for the family to view the school  experience as positive and responsive. The following tips  are designed to help you create and maintain effective  partnerships with families, leading to increased parent  involvement, and ultimately better outcomes for children. </p>
