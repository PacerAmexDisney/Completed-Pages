<h2>Engaging Culturally Diverse Families for Student Success</h2>

They must also understand how &ldquo;regular education&rdquo; works. </p>

  <p>In order to work effectively with families from diverse backgrounds, schools professionals need to understand the culture of the families they work with, and design outreach and communication strategies that respond to the specific social, cultural and linguistic needs and values of that group.&nbsp; &nbsp; This page includes a representative list of recent research literature on multicultural parent involvement and engagement, particularly those which address the interests and needs of educators. </p></td>

  <p> In addition to research-based information on effective family engagement practices, we wanted to hear directly from culturally and linguistically diverse parents and other family members about what they need to be meaningfully involved in their child&rsquo;s education.  We also wanted to hear from educators about what tools, support, or resources they need to promote family engagement with these families, with the shared goal of increasing student achievement. We gathered this information by conducting culturally-specific parent focus groups and facilitating interactive school-staff discussion groups.</p></td>

<h2>About Us –</h2>
<p>The Minnesota School and Family Connection project is a 5-year collaborative effort by PACER Center, <a href="http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/JustParent/FamPartners/index.html" target="_blank">Minnesota Department of Education (MDE) <span class="fa fa-external-link"></span></a> and Minneapolis and St. Paul school districts to increase effective family engagement with culturally and linguistically diverse families, with a focus on families of children with disabilities. MDE defines <em>family engagement</em> as &ldquo;the collaboration of families, schools and communities as active partners in the shared responsibilities of ensuring each student&rsquo;s success in lifelong learning and development.&rdquo; The project has been funded by the MDE&rsquo;s federal State Personnel Development Grant award.</p>
<p>Schools with high numbers of children with disabilities who are also English Language learners or from minority backgrounds face unique challenges to student achievement. Research, as well as experience, has shown parent involvement and engagement to be key factors in student success.</p>
<p> Building on a foundation of current research and supported by parent focus group and school staff feedback, PACER parent advocates and multicultural specialists worked with school staff to design customized training and resources for families and educators. The strategies, activities, tools and resources have been researched, produced, piloted, refined, and made available for use by educators and families.</p>
<p> Training videos, research literature, practice guides and tools are offered for educators and school administrators to build effective home-school communication and promote meaningful family engagement. Families will find corresponding resources created just for them and translated into <a href="/publications/spanish.asp">Spanish</a>, <a href="/publications/somali.asp">Somali</a> and<a href="/publications/hmongseasian.asp"> Hmong</a> on our Parent Page. Be sure to explore the parent tools and resources and share them with families you are working with, or use them in your parent outreach events at school.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.1em;">The parent is the expert on their child. The educator has expertise in their field. Together we can make a difference!</p>
