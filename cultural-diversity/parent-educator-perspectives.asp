<h1>Parent and Educator Perspectives</h1>
<p>
In addition to research-based information on effective family engagement practices, we wanted to hear directly from culturally and linguistically diverse parents and other family members about what they need to be meaningfully involved in their child&rsquo;s education.  We also wanted to hear from educators about what tools, support, or resources they need to promote family engagement with these families, with the shared goal of increasing student achievement. We gathered this information by conducting culturally-specific parent focus groups and facilitating interactive school-staff discussion groups.</p>

  <p>Schools talk about the importance of &ldquo;Parent Involvement&rdquo; or &ldquo;Parent Engagement.&rdquo; Schools use these terms to mean several different things. Some of the main ways parents are &ldquo;involved&rdquo;—or participate are by: </p>
   <ul>
    <li>Volunteering in the classroom or at school events or activities;  </li>
    <li>Attending school events such as Orientation, Open House, Family Nights and meetings about your child such as parent-teacher conferences; </li>
    <li>Working with your child at home on homework, reading to your child, preparing them for school; </li>
    <li>Being a part of a group that advises the school or helps make decisions such as the school site council. </li>
