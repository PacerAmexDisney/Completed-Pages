            <p>The Youth Advisory Board developed a Peer Support Comfort Agreement that is reviewed and honored at each Youth Advisory Board meeting. The intention of the Comfort Agreement is to ensure that all members are heard equally, without bias, and are given opportunity to participate.  The Comfort Agreement is reviewed at the beginning of each Board meeting.</p>
          <p><strong>Peer Support Comfort Agreement:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>President will inform the board when a topic is open for discussion</li>
            <li>President will recognize each speaker when the speaker raises his/her hand</li>
            <li>President will inform the board if the topic being discussed is part of an ongoing conversation and hands do not need to be raised in order to participate</li>
            <li>Members should not interrupt another member when they are speaking</li>
            <li>Members should respect each other’s opinions and right to speak</li>
            <li>Members will try to follow the rules</li>
            <li>Board members can ask to review the Comfort Agreement at any time</li>
            <li>The Comfort Agreement will be read and reviewed at the beginning of each board meeting</li>
