	<h1>When and Where to Get Help</h1>
		
<div id="expandcontentwrapper">

<p>Some children struggle with mood, anxiety, impulse control, or sensory integration. Parents become concerned when their child&rsquo;s social, emotional, or behavioral needs become more difficult to meet and are disruptive to daily life. Knowing when to be concerned, how to get help, and who to ask for information and support is a good place to start.</p>

      <p>Some children struggle with social, emotional, or behavioral challenges once they start school. It&rsquo;s helpful to ask your child what&rsquo;s working and what&rsquo;s not, and write it down to share with his or her teacher.

Here are some situations where you may consider asking for help:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Your child has a decline in overall academic performance.</li>
 				<li>Your child has poor grades despite making a good effort.</li>
 				<li>Your child is removed from class repeatedly for behaviors such as being disruptive or withdrawn, &ldquo;shutting down,&rdquo; or refusing to do schoolwork.</li>
 				<li>Your child is being suspended regularly for the same types of behavior and is showing persistent disobedience.</li>
 				<li>Your child is refusing to go to school (truancy).</li>
 				<li>Your child is complaining more often (e.g., headache or stomachache) and medical conditions have been ruled out.</li>
 				<li>Your child refuses to do homework or study at home.</li>

    	<p class="sub5">(Birth-3 yrs)</p>
      <p>Early intervention services are designed to meet the developmental needs of an eligible infant or toddler with a disability, and to assist families in helping their child develop and learn. You can call your school district, county human services office, or public health office and ask for an intake for early childhood services. Referrals can also be made by doctors and others, such as day care providers, who work with young children. A professional will complete a screening and, based on the results, make a decision about whether or not your child needs to be evaluated. If you disagree with that decision, ask for a meeting to discuss why you disagree. It might be helpful to have a staff member from PACER help you. Call (952) 838-9000 to learn more.</p>

      <p class="sub5">(3-5 yrs)</p>
      <p>If your child is age 3 or older and has not had Early Childhood Special Education (ECSE) services, you can call your school district to ask for an evaluation. If your child already has an Individual Family Service Plan (IFSP) through early childhood, the Individualized Education Program (IEP) team must meet before the child&rsquo;s 3rd birthday to prepare for the transition from the early intervention program to a preschool program. The team should consider whether or not a child could make appropriate progress in an integrated environment if the right supports and services were provided.  They also must justify any decision to provide educational services in a segregated setting. If the child qualifies, the parent must sign an IEP by the child&rsquo;s 3rd birthday.</p>
      <p class="sub5">School age (5-18 yrs)</p>
      <p>The first step is to call your child&rsquo;s teacher and ask for a meeting to discuss your concerns. Sometimes informal supports can be put into place to address the child&rsquo;s needs.</p>
      <p>If your child has a diagnosis from a medical provider, sharing that information with the child&rsquo;s teacher, social worker, or school principal may be helpful in having your concerns addressed.</p>
      <p>Call your child&rsquo;s school administrator and ask to speak with the staff member who is responsible for facilitating the special education services evaluation team. Once you have spoken with that person, put your evaluation request in writing. E-mail communication is acceptable, but it is a good idea to follow up with a written, signed, and dated copy of your request on paper. Remember to keep a copy for yourself.</p>
      <p>If your child already has a 504 Plan and is continuing to have significant challenges that disrupt his or her ability to learn (either academic and/or social emotional), request in writing an evaluation for special education services. An e-mail is acceptable, but follow up with a written, signed, and dated copy. Remember to keep a copy for yourself.</p>

    <div id="Item1_1_3" class="ExpandItem">
    	<p><strong>Right to an Evaluation:</strong> Anyone can refer a child for an evaluation. The parent or legal guardian also has the right to request an evaluation and participate in determining evaluation needs, developing the evaluation plan, and determining eligibility for special education.</p>
      <p><strong>Development of the IEP:</strong> The parent is part of the team that determines special education and related services listed on the IEP, which must be based on a documented evaluation. The initial IEP cannot be implemented without parent consent. In Minnesota, ongoing IEPs can be changed without written consent by the parent after 14 calendar days if the IEP team has met, agreed on those changes, documented them, and sent them to the parent in a prior written notice.</p>
      <p><strong>For a child with an IEP:</strong> Parents can request an IEP team meeting at any time when the child is not making progress; when new needs are identified (by a new diagnosis, failing grades, etc.); or when the child&rsquo;s behavior is resulting in negative consequences (e.g., suspensions, detentions, and time outs) and the child&rsquo;s access to education is being limited as a result of those consequences.</p>
      <p><strong>When a child&rsquo;s behavior results in significant disruption in the learning environment:</strong> Parents can request an IEP meeting to discuss their concerns and the need to make changes in the IEP. The parent can ask for an updated evaluation, a functional behavioral assessment (FBA) or a new FBA if one has already been done, changes to the current IEP, a Manifestation Determination meeting if necessary, or positive behavior interventions.</p>

    	<p class="sub5">Early childhood (Birth-5 yrs)</p>
      <p>For young children, it is generally more appropriate to determine needs through a screening or evaluation process. For children 3-5 years of age, it&rsquo;s important to identify any developmental concerns in the areas of cognition, communication, physical development, social/emotional, or adaptive living skills in early intervention programs the child may be attending. Early intervention is a system of supports to help families enhance their capacity to care for their children.</p>
			<p class="sub5">School age (5-18 yrs)</p>
      <p>Call your school district office or school principal to find contact information for the 504 coordinator. Send a copy of your written request for a 504 Plan to the coordinator and keep a copy for your records. Make certain that you have documentation of your child&rsquo;s disability, which can include learning, behavior, or attention issues.</p>
			<p>A 504 Plan is created by a group of people who are familiar with your child, which might include the parent, school social worker, general education teachers, and the school principal. A 504 Plan may be based on informal evaluation data, reports and diagnoses made outside the school, or a school evaluation. You can ask for an evaluation if you think there is more information needed about your child in order to develop a good 504 Plan or other plan of support.</p>

The Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments of 2008 (ADA) broadened the definition of disability in the ADA as well as in Section 504.</p>

          	<p>How does a school determine if a child is eligible for services either under IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973? The adapted Minnesota Department of Education chart on the other side gives you an idea of how the two processes work. You can find more information in other PACER publications, such as <a href="/publications/pdfs/ALL17.pdf" target="_blank">Understanding the Special Education Process <span class="fa fa-file-pdf-o"></span> <span class="fa fa-external-link"></span></a>.

        	 <p>Some students with disabilities who receive special education services need accommodations or modifications to their educational program in order to participate in the general curriculum and to be successful in school. While the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and its regulations do not define accommodations or modifications, there is some agreement as to what they mean. An accommodation as used in this document allows a student to complete the same assignment or test as other students, but with a change in the timing, formatting, setting, scheduling, response and/or presentation. This accommodation does not alter in any significant way what the test or assignment measures. Examples of accommodations include a student who is blind taking a Braille version of a test or a student taking a test alone in a quiet room.</p>
					<p>A modification as used in this document is an adjustment to an assignment or a test that changes the standard or what the test or assignment is supposed to measure. Examples of modifications include a student completing work on part of a standard or a student completing an alternate assignment that is more easily achievable than the assignment.</p>

        	 <p>Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (34 C.F.R. Part 104) is a federal civil rights statute that assures individuals will not be discriminated against based on their disability. All school districts that receive federal funding are responsible for the implementation of this law. This law protects a student with an impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, whether the student receives special education services or not.</p>

  <div id="Item1_3" class="ExpandItem">
 		<p>Children and youth in Minnesota may have access to mental health supports at school through school-linked mental health services. It is not a requirement in Minnesota for schools to provide these services, but a grant program from the Children&rsquo;s Mental Health Division at the Minnesota Department of Human Services has given some schools the opportunity to partner with community-based mental health providers so that students can have access to services at school. This partnership offers easier access for early intervention and treatment to prevent more serious mental illness, and offers students support in a natural, non-stigmatizing setting.</p>

  	<p>The school-wide positive behavior interventions and supports (SW-PBIS) approach is to use proactive, research-based strategies to teach clearly defined behavioral expectations across the entire school. SW-PBIS is a process of planning and problem solving that includes direct teaching of social behaviors in the same was academics are taught. It establishes ongoing behavior supports that can be used by ALL students, staff, volunteers, parents, and community members. It is used with all students across all environments in school (classroom, lunchroom, restroom, and playground) to help schools to create effective learning environments.</p>
		<p>The Minnesota Department of Education launched a state initiative for School-wide Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (SW-PBIS) in 2005. The goal was to help selected schools successfully educate all students, especially those with challenging behaviors. </p>

 	<h3 id="Level2_1" class="ExpandHeader">Mental health services covered by health plans</h3>
  <div id="Item2_1" class="ExpandItem">
  	<p>Health insurance plans can cover a variety of mental health services, including outpatient and/or in-home therapies, medication management, day treatment, partial hospitalization programs, residential treatment programs, neuropsychological evaluations, and hospitalization. Parents seeking information about their plan&rsquo;s coverage can contact their health plan and ask to speak with a care manager or care coordinator who specializes in mental health coverage services for children and youth. Parents can also request a copy of their health plan&rsquo;s mental health service options.</p>
		<p>Private insurance, public insurance, and a combination of private and public insurance may be used to cover the cost of mental health services.</p>
     <h3 id="Level2_1_1" class="ExpandHeader">Private insurance</h3>
     <div id="Item2_1_1" class="ExpandItem">
      <p>There are numerous private insurance options for both individuals and families in Minnesota. Private insurance can come through an employer or be purchased individually. When choosing a private insurance plan or deciding whether to switch insurance plans, it is important to consider a few key points:</p>
			<ul>
      	<li>If a parent wants a specific doctor or clinic to provide care for their youth, it is important that the doctor be on the new plan&rsquo;s preferred or network provider list. Most insurance companies offer better coverage for medical services from the doctors on their provider lists. Some plans do not cover out-of-network providers except for emergencies. </li>
       	<li>It is wise to compare insurance plans. If asked, insurance companies can provide you copies of their certificate of coverage which describe the plans&rsquo; benefits, exclusions, and conditions. The certificate of coverage explains the health benefits you and your dependents have under the plan. It details the services that will and will not be covered. Services that are not covered are called exclusions. The actions you have to take to receive the health benefits—such as a co-pay, meeting a deductible, or using particular health care providers—are called conditions.</li>
      	<li>When you enroll in a health insurance plan, you are given a certificate of coverage. It may also be called a contract, evidence of coverage, explanation of benefits, or summary plan description (SPD). You can call your insurance customer service department at any point and ask for a written copy. This should be provided free of charge. If you have specific questions about your coverage, you can also ask to speak with a care coordinator who specializes in your plan&rsquo;s mental health coverage.</li>
				<li>Some plans cover prescriptions. Others require the purchase of a separate prescription coverage plan.</li>

    <h3 id="Level2_1_2" class="ExpandHeader">Public insurance</h3>
    <div id="Item2_1_2" class="ExpandItem">
    	<p>As part of the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, Minnesota has developed a state insurance exchange called MNsure. The MNsure website has information on all public and private insurance options within Minnesota.</p>
			<p>Medical Assistance (MA) is Minnesota&rsquo;s Medicaid program. It provides services to low-income senior citizens and families, and individuals with disabilities. There are income limits to qualify for this program and you can apply through the MNsure website.</p>
     	<p>Medical Assistance-TEFRA (Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act) is a program that provides services to children with disabilities whose parents have too much income to qualify for other Minnesota public health care programs, or who qualify but the cost would be too high. Under TEFRA, families may have to pay a parental fee based on income and family size. To receive MA-TEFRA, children must:</p>
    	<ul>
     		<li>Live with at least one parent</li>
     		<li>Be under age 19</li>
     		<li>Be determined to have disability by the State Medical Review Team, with information provided by the child&rsquo;s parent and doctors, including certification of disability by Social Security, if applicable</li>
     		<li>Need a certain level of home health care to stay at home, care which compares to the level of care provided in a hospital, nursing home, or an intermediate care facility for people with developmental disabilities</li>
     		<li>Need home care that does not cost more than the cost of care in a medical facility</li>
    	</ul>
    	<p>It is important for families who might be considering out-of-home placement for their child, such as a residential treatment program, to consider applying for Medical Assistance or MA-TEFRA. In order for Medical Assistance or MA-TEFRA to cover out of home placement, the county must be involved with the placement from the beginning.</p>

    <div id="Item2_1_3" class="ExpandItem">
    	<p>Private insurance for Minnesota families of children with disabilities or special health care needs may not be enough to cover the cost of all needed health care services. In that case, the family may consider obtaining public insurance as well, including Medical Assistance (MA) or Medical Assistance-TEFRA (Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act). If a child qualifies for MA-TEFRA, this program may also pay outstanding medical bills for services received up to three months before the date of the family&rsquo;s application.</p>
     	<p>A family currently using both private and public insurance may wish to contact its county human services department or county financial worker to determine if it is cost-effective for the county to pay the family&rsquo;s monthly private insurance premium. The family must still pay the monthly TEFRA parental fee. Other states may have a different process.</p>

  <div id="Item2_3" class="ExpandItem">
  	<p>Children and youth benefit from activities where they can build new skills, connect with others, and have experiences within their community that are both positive and engaging. Sometimes when a child or youth is experiencing increased mental health or behavioral challenges, parents can struggle to find an activity or program that fits. If this happens, don&rsquo;t get discouraged; take time to talk with your child about his or her interests. Consider reaching out to individuals and organizations in your community, and learn more about the different activities your child may be interested in exploring with your assistance, and how they can get support. Individuals and communities can make a difference and contribute to healthy emotional and social growth.</p>
		<p>The following are some suggestions to start matching your child&rsquo;s strengths and interests with community based supports:</p>
