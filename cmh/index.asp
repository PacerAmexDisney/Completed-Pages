<p><strong>Gov. Dayton proclaims September as National Recovery Month</strong></p>
<p>September marks the 27th annual National Recovery Month, designed to bring greater awareness to the value of chemical and mental health treatment. This year&rsquo;s theme, &ldquo;Join the Voices for Recovery: Our Families, Our Stories, Our Recovery!&rdquo; highlights the value of peer support by educating, mentoring and helping others.</p>
<p>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) reported in 2014 that about 21.5 million Americans ages 12 and older (8.1%) were classified with a substance use disorder in the past year. Of those, 2.6 million had problems with both alcohol and drugs.  By 2020, mental and substance use disorders will surpass all physical diseases as a major cause of disability worldwide.</p>
<p>PACER&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Mental Health and Emotional or Behavioral Disorders Project brings together parents, youth, and professionals to help families receive the resources and support their children need.</p>
<p>Recovery Month will include a variety of ceremonies, activities, and celebrations across the state. <a href="http://www.dhs.state.mn.us/main/groups/disabilities/documents/pub/dhs-288967.pdf" target="_blank"><span class="fa fa-file-pdf-o"></span> Read Gov.

<h2 class="header_bar">How well do you know your Mental Health Facts?</h2>
<p>Having a mental health challenge or a behavioral disorder is  more common than most people imagine. In fact, children are diagnosed with  mental health disorders at a rate of 6.8% and at an even higher rate in  adolescence. It is likely that each of us has known someone with a mental  health or behavioral challenge or had one ourselves. Mental health disorders don&rsquo;t discriminate based on age,  race, gender, ethnicity, occupation, religion, economic class, or ethnic  background. Misconceptions about mental health can contribute to the lack of  funding and public support for effective treatment and supports for children  and young adults.</p>

              <p>True or False: Mental illnesses can be cured with willpower.</p>

              <div class="ExpandItem" style="margin-top:-50px;">
                <p><strong>False. </strong>A mental illness does not stem from character flaws, and willpower   doesn&rsquo;t cure a mental illness. Mental illness is a category of many   different mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, schizophrenia,   anorexia, or bipolar disorder. Current research provides a better   understanding of how the brain works and what happens when a child,   youth, or adult experience challenges with thought, mood, behavior, or   interactions with others. Just as cancer, heart disease, or diabetes are   medical conditions, so is mental illness. </p>

              <div class="ExpandItem" style="margin-top:-50px;">
                <p><strong>False.</strong> Research has found that having a biological relative such as a parent, grandparent, or sibling with a mental illness is a <em>risk factor</em>;   it does not determine whether someone will develop a mental illness.   Other risk factors associated with developing a mental illness include   having a chronic medical condition, experiencing abuse as a child,   experiencing traumatic life situations, exposure to toxins such as   alcohol during pregnancy, or misuse of substances including alcohol or   drugs. Research demonstrates that <em>protective factors </em>can help   to counteract these risk factors. Examples of protective factors include   a good social support system, adequate food, safe shelter, financial   security, good problem-solving skills, and access to positive   recreational activities. </p>

              <p><strong>True.</strong><em> Childhood mental health disorder </em>is a term used to explain   all mental disorders that can be diagnosed and begin in childhood. Many   adults who have a diagnosed psychiatric disorder experienced the onset   of their symptoms in adolescence or childhood. Embarrassment, fear, peer   pressure, lack of community support, and stigma can prevent or delay a   person from getting help. Early intervention is important to managing   and recovering from mental health challenges. </p>

              <p><strong>False.</strong> With the right kind of medical care, many children and youth who   experience mental health challenges can and do lead healthy, productive,   and satisfying daily lives. While the illness may not go away, the   symptoms or challenges can be managed with appropriate treatment and   support.

              <p><strong>False.</strong> The majority of people living with a mental illness are not violent   and are not at risk of becoming violent. One research study looked at   violence risk among people with serious mental illness and found a   mental health diagnosis is not a significant indicator of whether a   person will be violent. Factors that do tell us something about whether a   person might be at risk for violence include: (1) a history of violent   victimization early in life; (2) substance use; and (3) exposure to   violence in their environment. There are a small number of individuals   who experience mental health challenges that can include aggression. For   these individuals, access to treatment, supports, and timely   intervention are necessary components for recovery.</p>

              <div class="ExpandItem" style="margin-top:-50px;">
              <p><strong>True.</strong> Many people confuse mental illnesses with intellectual disabilities,   but they are different from each other. Mental illnesses are medical   conditions that disrupt a person&rsquo;s thinking, mood, daily functioning, or   ability to relate to others. Intellectual disabilities are a type of   developmental disability characterized by significant limitations in   both intellectual functioning (e.g., a person&rsquo;s IQ or intellectual quotient)   and adaptive behavior (social and practical skills). Individuals who   have an intellectual disability are more susceptible to developing a   mental illness.</p>

They   may also be struggling with an addiction that requires medical   intervention. Ongoing alcohol and drug use can play a role in the   development or worsening of some mental health symptoms and disorders.

Some parents may require   extra assistance with parenting tasks when faced with any medical   condition or health challenge including a mental illness. Unfortunately,   parents face significant barriers to accessing treatments and parenting   supports because of the stigma associated with mental illness. Family   life can be healthy and meaningful when both parents and children   acknowledge and understand the illness, have support, and communicate   with each other about the issues.</p>

              <p><strong>True.</strong> Children are required to attend school. Public schools are required   to provide education for all students, including those with   disabilities. There are options for a child with mental health   challenges who is having difficulty with school, including both informal   and formal supports. An informal support could be attending a   &ldquo;friendship group&rdquo; or having a &ldquo;check-in&rdquo; person. A formal support might   include having a 504 Plan, or doing an evaluation for Special Education services. Some schools have school-wide initiatives to promote the mental health and wellness of all students. These might include positive behavior interventions and supports (PBIS), social-emotional learning (SEL) , school-linked mental health services, bullying prevention initiatives, trauma-informed care, and youth mental health crisis response services.</p>

<h3>Oliver</h3>
<p>Hello. My name is Oliver and I am 19 years old.  I am a recent high school graduate and have been a Youth Board member and officer for 5 years. This fall I will be attending the University of Iowa.</p>
<p>I have lots of hobbies including reading, listening to music, traveling, and watching sports. </p>
<p>  Anxiety has been a major challenge for me, and I have discovered that reading is a good coping tool.  It kind of settles me down.</p>
