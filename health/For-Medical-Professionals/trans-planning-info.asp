        <h2>Transition Planning Information for Physicians to Share with Families</h2>
        <p>Transition planning is a process that occurs as teens develop and become young adults and learn to function more independently. It is a time of realizing potential, developing a sense of self, and functioning more autonomously. Transition can be difficult. Youth with special health care needs (YSHCN), including those with disabilities, can find this time challenging. Many transition areas will require the learning of new skills that take time, practice, and adaptations to be accomplished.</p>
        <p>Transition planning for these youth requires planning, and will evolve and may change over time. Some articles recommend that the process begin as early as age 12, but clearly by 14. Skills such as organization, self-advocacy, learning about one&rsquo;s disability, and addressing the many areas of life where assistance might be needed take time to develop. The following discussion points are provided as a framework to assist families, physicians, and young adults with special health care needs to begin the conversation, and help them transition to the most independent life possible.</p>
        <p>Transition can be divided into three major areas:</p>
        <ol style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
          <li>Transition from pediatric health care to adult providers</li>
          <li>High school to post-secondary education or employment</li>
          <li>Transition from home to more independence in the community</li>
        </ol>

            <h3 class="ExpandHeader greenBar"> <em style="font-size:10px;">(click to expand)</em> Transfer from pediatric health care to adult providers</h3>
            <p>A young person&rsquo;s health is critical to his or her overall well-being. Good health is crucial for individuals to be successful at home, work, school, and in the community. For individuals with disabilities, transition planning may involve understanding how to manage their chronic health condition as well as having the ability to recognize and address issues related to an acute illness, and developing a healthy lifestyle. To ensure a successful transition, youth with special health care needs have to secure accommodations or needed supports that enable them to be successful.</p>
            <div class="ExpandItem">
                <ol>
                  <li><strong>Transition planning goals: </strong>It is important to identify the short- and long-term goals that lead to healthy living, independence, and employment. These may change as the teen matures and learns more about the potential long-term impact of his or her disability. An individual&rsquo;s goals may shape care coordination when the health care transition process begins. When setting goals, it is also important to consider the cultural and racial values of individuals with diverse backgrounds.<br />
                    <br />

                  <li><strong>Self-advocacy</strong>: Youth with special health care needs display a wide range of abilities related to self-advocacy. Each clinic visit offers an opportunity to build advocacy skills, empowering the youth to be more involved in transition and increasing the opportunity to gain more skills. The following list offers suggestions of where to start the process of addressing each teen&rsquo;s skills, and building on their knowledge and ability to self-advocate.<br />

                  <li><strong>Addressing emotional needs</strong>: Transition is a time for young adults that may include increasing awareness of their disability. Youth, including those with disabilities, begin seeing themselves as adults. They want to participate in conversations with their physician and should be part of the decision-making process.<br />

                          <li>Consider referral to a counselor, therapist or diagnosis-specific support group if appropriate.</li>
                          <li>It is helpful to know what resources are available in the community to support both parents and youth as they start the process of transition. This may include respite care for the parents and/or personal care attendant services for the youth.</li>

                  <li><strong>Organizational skills needed for success</strong>: Identify skills that the parent and youth can include in the Individualized Education Program (IEP). Transition goals on the IEP can be connected to medical transition needs.<br />

        <p>Transition for youth with special health care needs can be a very positive experience as well as a challenging process that requires the collaboration of medical providers, schools, and families. It is important for families to start the process when the youth is 12 to 14 years old, and identify short- and long-term goals. Progress toward these goals can be broken down into small steps and included in both the IEP and physician visits. The goals will likely be modified over time as the individual matures and becomes a young adult. The discussion points and checklists provided here are intended as a helpful starting point for physicians and families to assist teens and young adults as they transition into independent living.</p>
