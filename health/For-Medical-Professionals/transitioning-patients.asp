<h2>Transitioning Patients from Pediatric to Adult Care</h2>
<img class="fltrt mobileCentered" src="/health/images/doctor-dad-baby.jpg" width="250" height="302" alt="" />

<p>One way to improve health outcomes for youth with special health care needs is ensuring that they successfully transition from pediatric to adult health care. Health care providers help with this transition by ensuring youth:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Understand their changing health needs</li>
  <li>Take more responsibility for managing their own care</li>
  <li>Identify appropriate adult health care providers</li>
  <li>Maintain insurance coverage</li></ul>

	A young person&rsquo;s health is critical to his or her overall well-being.   Good health provides a solid foundation for success at home, work,   school, and in the community. As children become adults, families must   determine how a young person&rsquo;s health care expenses will be covered once   they are no longer covered on the family policy or by a children&rsquo;s   health care program. Many families also experience the challenge of   transitioning from a long trusted pediatrician to a new adult health   care provider.</p>
