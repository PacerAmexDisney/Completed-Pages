<h2>A. BACKGROUND</h2>
  <h4>1) PACER&rsquo;s Pediatric Resident Training Program for Transition Youth and Their Families </h4>
  <p>PACER is a Minnesota and national nonprofit parent center with 35 years of success providing innovative resources, training, and support to families of children with special health care needs and all disabilities, including 20 years of operating Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) family projects. PACER&rsquo;s Family-to-Family (F2F) Health Information Center reaches thousands of parents and professionals annually through one-to-one assistance, trainings, website and publications.</p>
  <p>Since children with special health care needs are best served by Family-Centered Care delivered through a Medical Home model, PACER Center identified a need to increase pediatricians&rsquo; understanding of the health care system from the family&rsquo;s perspective in order to provide the highest quality treatment. PACER&rsquo;s Parents as Teachers (PAT) resident teaching program has been operating successfully at the University of Minnesota&rsquo;s Department of Pediatrics since 1991 and has more than 20 years of data that demonstrates important outcomes for more than 600 residents and over 50 families who have participated. As a result of the program, pediatric residents have been able to successfully incorporate what they have learned into their medical practices, potentially impacting thousands of individuals in the community. At the same time, parents have learned how to become better advocates for their children, and partner more effectively with their physicians.</p>
  <p>Program evaluations indicate that 97% of residents who have participated say the program was useful and worthwhile. Upon completion of the program, residents gave themselves 4.18 on a scale of 5 as being prepared to incorporate families&rsquo; points of view into clinical or hospital visits.</p>
  <p>PACER&rsquo;s Parents as Teachers program enables residents to participate during the Developmental Behavioral Pediatric (DBP) rotation. This rotation focuses on establishing the family/parent perspective with regard to family-centered care, medical home, community-based resources, and coordinated care for children and youth with special health care needs by matching each family with a resident who visits them in their home or community. Information about these areas is provided to residents during training sessions prior to the family visit.</p>
  <p>In 2012, PACER expanded the Parents as Teachers program so that the pediatric residents had a second opportunity to meet with families during their adolescent rotation. Known as the Pediatric Resident Training Program (PRTP), this opportunity includes an expansion of the key concepts of medical home, family-centered care and children and youth with special health care needs. In addition, the curriculum focuses on both cultural competency and transition of pediatric medical care to adult services. Residents are matched with families, including those with diverse backgrounds, who have experienced health care, education, and community living transitions with their teenager or young adult with special health care needs or disabilities. The Pediatric Resident Training Program&rsquo;s family visit helps residents develop a more comprehensive understanding of the complex issues families face as their children develop, and make the transition to a more independent life. Residents receive information and resources they will need to create medical homes for families as these physicians establish their practices in rural and urban areas nationwide. Residents also receive training about diverse cultures and the unique issues associated with health care delivery in these communities.</p>
  <p>Youth and young adults with special health care needs also participate in the resident visit, providing an opportunity for the physicians to learn about health care access and transition skill development in ways that may not occur in a traditional health care setting. When residents visit, many families include them in whatever normal activities are occurring that day &ndash; from family events to multi-generational home environments, community cultural activities, or youth-directed recreational activities.</p>
  <h4>2) Parents, young adults and youth with special health care needs or disabilities</h4>
  <p>PACER&rsquo;s Pediatric Resident Training Program provides leadership training to parents of children and youth with special health care needs and disabilities. The parents are their child&rsquo;s best advocate, and PACER seeks parents and families who are willing to participate in the program and share their health care experience with residents.</p>
  <p>The Pediatric Resident Training Program identifies families with youth and young adults ages 14 to 25 who are beginning the transition process at school, and need to begin addressing the many issues they&rsquo;ll face in the years ahead. Some participating families have previously been in the Parents as Teachers program and their children are now at the age when they are starting the transition process. There is also a focus on recruiting more racially and culturally diverse families and at least three to four families are trained each year to participate in the program. Through each family&rsquo;s cultural lens, the Pediatric Resident Training Program participants share their experiences of navigating the health care system, adapting their family life and integrating their child or young adult in the community based on their needs.</p>
  <h4>3) Medical residents</h4>
  <p>Medical residents are physicians. They have graduated medical school, and earned a medical doctor degree (MD) designation. Prior to that, they will have completed an undergraduate education, and some may have acquired additional graduate degrees before entering medical school. Residency is the training required to become board certified in a specific medical area such as family practice, pediatrics, or internal medicine. Residency programs range from three to eight years, depending on the specific program and specialty involved, and residents are paid, practicing doctors who work with patients while under supervision. </p>
  <p>Residency schedules are organized into &lsquo;rotations&rsquo; where residents spend several weeks with a specific focus and then move on to another focus or setting. Residencies are unique to each program and specialty, with first-year residents (usually called interns) practicing under the supervision of more senior residents and attending physicians. The Pediatric Resident Training Program is designed to be a part of a pediatrics, or joint internal medicine and pediatrics (often called MedPeds), residency program. It was specifically developed in collaboration with the Department of Pediatrics at the University of Minnesota for residents on their adolescent rotation.</p>
  <hr />
  <h2>B. PARTNERS</h2>
  <p>In order to improve the system serving children and youth with special health care needs, PACER&rsquo;s Pediatric Resident Training Program relies on partners and collaborators in all aspects of program design and delivery. A collaborating parent center is needed to coordinate the various aspects of the program. Center staff identify and train families of teens and young adults with special health care needs to host resident visits in their homes. The University of Minnesota has incorporated the Pediatric Resident Training Program into its residency education program, and it provides administrative support to arrange resident visits, and stipends to families who participate.</p>
  <h4>1) Coordinating partner</h4>
  <p>In Minnesota, PACER Center serves as the coordinating center for the Pediatric Resident Training Program. The coordinating partner has the initial responsibilities to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Identify staff to implement the program.</li>
  <li>Identify parents of teens and young adults with special health care needs and disabilities to participate in the program.</li>
  <li>Identify a source of health care providers in training, such as physician assistants, nurse practitioners, or other health care professionals if there is no pediatric resident program nearby, or if the new project is looking for alternatives.</li>
  <li>Collaborate with a program director, clinic director, or organization that will be responsible for the availability and scheduling of the health care providers each month.</li>
  <li>Develop orientation curriculum (see below).</li>
  <li>Develop an agenda and activities for a debriefing session.</li>
  <li>Develop pre- and post-visit surveys, or use PACER&rsquo;s.</li>
  <li>Collect, enter, and evaluate data.</li>
</ul>
<p>PACER Health Information Center staff and multicultural advocates also help identify, recruit, and introduce families to the Pediatric Resident Training Program staff.&nbsp; PACER provides language and American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters for resident visits based on family and youth requests.</p>
  <p>There are several options available for community agencies that can act as coordinating centers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Family-to-Family Health Information Centers</li>
  <li>Parent Training and Information Centers</li>
  <li>Family Voices, or State Affiliate Organizations</li>
  <li>Parent-to-Parent Organizations</li>
  <li>Other parent disability organizations</li>
</ul>
<h4>2) Families</h4>
  <p>The Pediatric Resident Training Program relies on parents as well as youth and young adults with special health care needs who are willing to participate and share their health care experience with residents. There are a number of different sources to help identify these families. These include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://mchb.hrsa.gov/programs/familytofamily/index.html" target="_blank"><strong>Family-to-Family Health Information Centers</strong></a> which are in every state and help families of children with special health care needs or disabilities navigate various systems.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.parentcenternetwork.org/parentcenterlisting.html" target="_blank"><strong>Parent Training and Information Centers</strong></a> provide information, training, and assistance to families of children with disabilities ages birth to 26, and to professionals who work with them.</li>
  <li><strong>Disability-specific organizations</strong> in each state: Organizations with connections to families whose children have specific diagnoses, such as autism, Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, and cystic fibrosis, may be able help identify potential participants on a local level.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.nacdd.org/about-nacdd/councils-on-developmental-disabilities.aspx" target="_blank"><strong>National Association of Councils on Developmental Disabilities</strong></a> has information on how to locate each state&rsquo;s Council on Developmental Disabilities, which may have members who are parent representatives or self-advocates who would be interested in joining the Pediatric Resident Training Program. </li>
  <li><strong>Cultural leaders in diverse communities</strong> can help find multicultural families who have children with special health care needs. Contact PACER Center for the name of a Parent Center in your area to find local cultural leaders.</li>
</ul>
<h4>3) Medical residents</h4>
  <p>While the Pediatric Resident Training Program is designed to be a part of a pediatrics or joint internal medicine pediatrics residency program, other residencies, such as family practice or psychiatry could potentially be a good fit. Clinics where residents do their rotations may also be good partners. Physician assistants, nurse practitioners, or others who see patients independently may offer an avenue to raise awareness and achieve program goals. Some universities also have Public Health Training programs.</p>
  <p>Here are some resources for identifying potential resident program partners:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.aamc.org/" target="_blank">Association of American Medical Colleges</a> website lists residency programs and specialties through its Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS), which is the national application site for physicians seeking residency and fellowship programs. </li>
  <li>Community clinics or federally qualified health clinics where residents do rotations.</li>
  <li>Physician assistant, public health professional programs and nursing programs: The <a href="http://www.paeaonline.org/index.php?ht=d/ContentDir/pid/255" target="_blank">Physician Assistant Education Association</a> has a list of U.S. physician assistant programs, the <a href="http://ceph.org/accredited/" target="_blank">Council on Education for Public Health</a> lists accredited public health programs, and the <a href="http://www.acenursing.net/accreditedprograms/directorySearch.htm" target="_blank">Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing</a> lists accredited nursing programs.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>C. PROGRAM DESIGN &amp; IMPLEMENTATION</h2>
  <h4>1) Community agency</h4>
  <p>Once partners have been determined, the community agency, parent center, or coordinating center needs to take multiple actions. These include:</p>
  <ol type="a">
  <li>Identify agency staff to implement the program. Characteristics of potential program leaders include:
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Family or individual experience navigating health care systems in the community. This gives credibility when working with families.</li>
  <li>Experience and ongoing working relationships with families of children with special health care needs and disabilities.</li>
  <li>Current working relationships with multicultural families or leaders in diverse communities.</li>
  <li>Ability to work closely with residency staff to review current curriculum and prevent duplication of information.</li>
</ul>
Staff should become familiar with PACER&rsquo;s Orientation curriculum (see <a href="/health/For-Medical-Professionals/PRTP-Toolkit/pdfs/Appendix-8a.pdf" target="_blank">Appendix 8a</a> and <a href="/health/For-Medical-Professionals/PRTP-Toolkit/pdfs/Appendix-9b.pdf" target="_blank">Appendix 9b</a>) and the <a href="http://www.pacer.org/health/For-Medical-Professionals/" target="_blank">For Medical Professionals</a> section (part of the Family to Family Health Information Center resources) at PACER.org. Other opportunities for staff development include participating in webinars, attending national conferences, or serving on national, state or local health care-related boards.</li>
  <li>Once coordinating center staff are identified and trained, the following steps need to be taken to implement the program:
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Train parents who have been identified and agreed to participate.</li>
  <li>Conduct an orientation session for residents to review important issues for transitional youth who are moving toward adulthood. This includes family insights and resources and community issues such as housing, transportation, and guardianship as well as educational issues such as post-secondary education, employment, or day services. There should be an emphasis on transition from pediatric to adult health care systems (see curriculum below).</li>
  <li>Administer a self-assessment survey at the beginning of the orientation to determine the residents&rsquo; baseline level in working with teens with special health care needs, and people of other cultures. The survey also assesses the residents&rsquo; knowledge of the identified core concepts of medical home, family-centered care, and available community resources. <em>(see <a href="/health/For-Medical-Professionals/PRTP-Toolkit/pdfs/Appendix-1.pdf" target="_blank">Appendix 1</a>, section A)</em></li>
  <li>Determine the best match between participating families and residents. Begin by contacting families to determine availability for a particular rotation. Then assign each resident to a particular family based on individual interests and availability.</li>
  <li>E-mail contact information to families and residents so they can arrange a visit. Ask parents and residents to agree on a location for their first meeting, either in the community or at the family&rsquo;s home. Be sure to include the teen or transition age youth in the meeting. <em>(see <a href="/health/For-Medical-Professionals/PRTP-Toolkit/pdfs/Appendix-2.pdf" target="_blank">Appendix 2</a>)</em></li>
  <li>Send surveys and invoice forms to families and let them know you will be collecting the completed forms after the resident visit. <em>(see <a href="/health/For-Medical-Professionals/PRTP-Toolkit/pdfs/Appendix-3.pdf">Appendix 3</a> and <a href="/health/For-Medical-Professionals/PRTP-Toolkit/pdfs/Appendix-4.pdf" target="_blank">Appendix 4</a>)</em></li>
  <li>Hold a debriefing session at the end of the rotation. At PACER, the debriefing includes:
  <ul type="circle">
    <li>Residents describe their experience and share what they&rsquo;ve learned. </li>
    <li>Residents tour PACER Center.</li>
    <li>Residents learn about and tour PACER&rsquo;s Simon Technology Center (PACER.org/stc), and other PACER programs. </li>
    <li>PACER&rsquo;s multicultural staff from the Hmong, Somali, Latino, and African American communities participate in a panel discussion about issues that people from diverse cultures face in navigating the health care system.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>Residents complete the post-visit survey, which repeats questions from the pre-visit survey, and specifically addresses details of the visit, what they learned, and their recommendations for the program. <em>(See <a href="/health/For-Medical-Professionals/PRTP-Toolkit/pdfs/Appendix-1.pdf" target="_blank">Appendix 1</a>, sections B through G) </em></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Send follow-up surveys to parents and residents six months after the rotation to assess what they gained from their experience in the program, and to ask if they have had the opportunity to utilize the skills they acquired by participating. <em>(see <a href="/health/For-Medical-Professionals/PRTP-Toolkit/pdfs/Appendix-4.pdf" target="_blank">Appendix 4</a>)</em></li>
</ul></li></ol>
<h4>2) Parent/family participation</h4>
  <p>Once parents have been identified and agree to participate in the program, they receive training at PACER Center where they are treated as professionals, and their commitment and expertise is recognized with a monetary stipend. Training can be done as a group or individually. It lasts about an hour and includes a PowerPoint presentation, review of Pediatric Resident Training Program forms, and time for parents to ask questions about the program. The training concludes with a tour of PACER Center to introduce or remind participants about workshops and resources available to the families and residents.</p>
  <p>PACER offers both initial and ongoing parent training resources:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Initial training includes:</strong> <em>(see <a href="/health/For-Medical-Professionals/PRTP-Toolkit/pdfs/Appendix-5.pdf" target="_blank">Appendix 5</a>, presentation)</em>
  <ul type="circle">
    <li>Parents as Teachers program history and goals</li>
    <li>Expansion of Parents as Teachers to Pediatric Resident Training Program </li>
    <li>Information on the residency program</li>
    <li>Tips on sharing experiences and telling their story</li>
    <li>Ground rules on discussing experiences</li>
    <li>Information on planning the visit</li>
    <li>Sample discussion topics</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><strong>Ongoing training includes:</strong>
  <ul type="circle">
    <li><strong>Annual educational event:</strong> PACER utilizes its annual Family and Resident Appreciation Dinner as an opportunity to build and maintain parent-professional relationships. Participants include residents, parents, teens, young adults, university resident coordinators, PACER staff coordinators, as well as PACER multicultural staff, and staff of the Simon Technology Center. Pediatric Resident Training Program parents and young adults give presentations on topics such as a parent&rsquo;s perspective on building a health care team, coordination between health care teams and educational teams, and collaboration between parents and professionals. New families gain peer support at the event by meeting families who have been in the program for some time. Residents and university staff deliver presentations on best practices of transition from pediatric to adult health care and on parent-professional relationships. <a href="/health/For-Medical-Professionals/pediatric-resident-training.asp" target="_blank">Here are the perspectives</a> from parents, a young adult, and two residents.</li>
    <li><strong>Periodic updates and opportunities:</strong> Pediatric Resident Training Program staff keep families informed about current national, regional, state, and local health-related topics, including new leadership opportunities such as committee openings at the state or local level. Families have an opportunity to network, participate in workshops, and gain valuable experience. They also receive periodic updates on new research-based parent and youth resources to assist in their navigation of the health care systems they are involved with.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>
<h4>3) Resident training</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Resident orientation:</strong> Resident orientation reviews key curriculum components and concepts including family-centered care, medical home, and children and youth with special health care needs. It describes the family visit and outlines transition issues that young adults and teens face. </li>
  <li><strong>Family visit:</strong> A day or two after the orientation, the program coordinator e-mails residents with the contact information for the family they will be visiting <em>(see <a href="/health/For-Medical-Professionals/PRTP-Toolkit/pdfs/Appendix-6.pdf" target="_blank">Appendix 6</a>).</em> It is up to the resident to follow up with the family and arrange a meeting. Sample questions and topics for discussion are included in the e-mail and are reviewed during orientation. Contact information for the program coordinator is also included in case unforeseen challenges arise when arranging the visit.</li>
  <li><strong>Resident debriefing:</strong> The two-hour debriefing session is a key component of the program that provides residents an opportunity to process what they have learned during the family visit. It helps make the connection between concepts discussed at the orientation with what they experienced during the family visit, and time is provided to complete the evaluation and discuss additional resources. Residents meet with PACER&rsquo;s multicultural staff to learn about the perspective of parents from diverse communities and ask related questions. Residents also tour PACER&rsquo;s Simon Technology Center to learn about assistive technology (AT) options available to families of children with special health care needs and disabilities, and learn about PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center, and COUNT ME IN&reg; and KIDS AGAINST BULLYING puppet programs. Residents are asked to provide their personal e-mail addresses so that they can receive surveys six months after their family visit. <em>(see <a href="/health/For-Medical-Professionals/PRTP-Toolkit/pdfs/Appendix-7.pdf" target="_blank">Appendix 7</a>)</em></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>D. CURRICULUM</h2>
  <p>Included below is an overview of the information covered during the orientation session. Copies of the lecture handouts and lecturer&rsquo;s notes can be found in the Appendix. There is a shorter, more concise version of these notes <em>(Appendix 8a and 8b)</em> and a longer, more detailed version <em>(<a href="/health/For-Medical-Professionals/PRTP-Toolkit/pdfs/Appendix-9a.pdf" target="_blank">Appendix 9a</a> and <a href="/health/For-Medical-Professionals/PRTP-Toolkit/pdfs/Appendix-9b.pdf" target="_blank">Appendix 9b</a>).</em></p>
  <h4>1) History of Pediatric Resident Training Program (PRTP)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Pediatric Resident Training Program is based on the Parents as Teachers (PAT) program, a collaboration of nearly 25 years between PACER Center and the University of Minnesota Pediatric Resident Training Program. Parents as Teachers occurs during the Developmental Behavioral Pediatrics (DBP) Rotation in the first year of residency.</li>
  <li>The program was expanded in 2012 to provide additional opportunities for residents to meet with families, and to increase the focus on transition from pediatric to adult healthcare and cultural competency.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>During the Adolescent Rotation, Pediatric Resident Training Program allows families and youth to share their knowledge, experience, and expertise with residents.</li>
</ul>
<h4>2) Goals of Pediatric Resident Training Program</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Review concepts of medical home, family-centered care, and community resources to support children and youth with special health care needs and/or disabilities</li>
  <li>Increase understanding, skills, and cultural competence among residents for working with diverse families and youth</li>
  <li>Increase knowledge of community resources to support transition from pediatric to adult systems of care.</li>
</ul>
<h4>3) Review and expand definitions</h4>
<ol type="a">
  <li><strong>Children and Youth with Special Health Care Needs:</strong> Children and youth who have a higher risk of chronic physical, development, behavioral, or emotional condition, and require a type or amount of health care services greater than most children.</li>
  <li><strong>Family- and Patient-Centered Care:</strong> Standard of practice that assures the health and well-being of children and their families through a respectful family-professional partnership. It honors the strengths, cultures, traditions and expertise that everyone brings to the relationship.</li>
  <li><strong>Medical Home:</strong> The definition of a medical home is not a building, house, hospital, or home healthcare service, it is an approach to comprehensive primary care where the pediatric care team works in partnership with the child and the child's family to assure that all of the medical and non-medical needs of the patient are met.</li>
  <li><strong>Identification of available community resources:</strong> For a complete listing of resources in Minnesota, visit PACER.org/health for the <a href="http://www.pacer.org/parent/php/PHP-c36.pdf" target="_blank">&ldquo;Resource List of Disability Organizations.&rdquo;</a>&nbsp; Many organizations have lists of resources for their states or communities. To locate a Parent Training and Information Center (PTI) or Community Parent Resource Center (CPRC) in your area, visit the <a href="http://www.parentcenterhub.org/find-your-center/" target="_blank">Center for Parent Information and Resources</a>.</li>
</ol>
  <h4>4) Transition areas</h4>
<p>The adolescent rotation focuses on the transition and adult skills that parents and youth with special health care needs/disabilities will have to prepare for as the young adult transitions into a more independent life. There are three primary areas, each of which is outlined below:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>a. Transfer from pediatric health care to adult providers</p>
    <p>b. Transfer from high school to post-secondary education/vocational school or employment</p>
    <p>c. Dependence on family to independence in the community.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>a. Transfer from pediatric health care to adult providers</h4>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Transition planning goals:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Identify short- and long-term goals toward independence and employment. These may change as the individual matures, and learns more about the potential long-term impact of their disability. The goals may also shape the care coordination when the health care transition process begins. </li>
      <li>Be respectful of diverse cultures that may have a different view of transition and how it impacts their youth with special health care needs and disabilities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Self-advocacy: </strong>Typical teens, as well as youth with special health care needs, display a wide range of abilities related to self-advocacy. Each clinic visit offers an opportunity to build advocacy skills, empowering the youth to be more involved in transition and increasing the opportunity to gain more comprehensive skills. The following list offers suggestions of where to start the process of addressing each teen&rsquo;s skills, and building on their knowledge and ability to self-advocate.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Does the individual know his or her diagnosis?</li>
      <li>Can the young adult describe his or her disability?</li>
      <li>Is the young adult able to express her needs and advocate for needed accommodations?</li>
      <li>Is the individual able to understand her physician&rsquo;s instructions?</li>
      <li>Can he be responsible for his own medications?</li>
      <li>Can he follow directions?</li>
      <li>Does she know the names of her medications?</li>
      <li>Does he know the side effects of his medications?</li>
      <li>Is she able to understand the importance of medication compliance?</li>
      <li>Would it be beneficial for the youth to have a medical binder, portable medical summary, or one-page summary outlining his or her disability and medical challenges and how these may impact behavior?</li>
      <li>Is there a role for assistive technology to help with tasks such as scheduling, reminders, and contact information?</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Emotional needs: </strong>Transition is a time for youth that may include increasing awareness of their disability. Youth, including those with disabilities, begin seeing themselves as adults. They want to participate in conversations with their physician, and should be part of the decision-making process.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>While some youth meet various goals, youth with special health care needs and his or her family may experience concerns and anxiety as they recognize that some goals may not be possible at this time. This might include a desire to obtain a driver&rsquo;s license, or the goal of being able to live independently. </li>
      <li>Consider referral to a counselor, therapist or diagnosis-specific support group if appropriate. </li>
      <li>It is helpful to know what resources are available in the community to support both parents and youth as they start the process of transition. This may include respite care for the parents or personal care attendants (PCA) services for the youth. </li>
      <li>Each culture takes a different view of transition, and some young adults with disabilities or special health care needs from diverse communities may continue indefinitely in their current living situation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Addressing basic health care needs:</strong> There are issues most youth in transition face, including young adults with special health care needs or disabilities. These issues include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Nutrition</li>
      <li>Hygiene</li>
      <li>Exercise</li>
      <li>Substance abuse</li>
      <li>Safety and risky behaviors</li>
      <li>Reproductive education</li>
      <li>Sexuality</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, some young adults may need extra support in these areas to make good decisions and master these skills.</p>
    <p><strong>Organizational skills needed for success: </strong>It&rsquo;s important to identify skills that the parent and youth can include in the Individualized Education Program (IEP). Transition goals on the IEP can also be connected to medical transition needs. Potential IEP objectives and goals might include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Setting up appointments, including scheduling and arriving on time</li>
      <li>Learning about medications from the school nurse</li>
      <li>Carrying an insurance card and understanding co-pays and deductibles</li>
      <li>Carrying or using a one-page summary of medical history and a medical binder</li>
      <li>Learning how to fill prescriptions, when to order refills, and how to pay for medications</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It&rsquo;s important to begin developing these skills early to minimize the number of surprises a student will face. Some items may also need to be revisited along the way.</p>
    <p><strong>Ensuring compliance: </strong>Compliance with a medication regimen is often the cornerstone to successful transition for many youth with special health care needs or disabilities. It is important to answer these questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Does he have reasonable organizational skills?</li>
      <li>Who will be responsible for administering or overseeing medications?</li>
      <li>Will she need help managing her medication, or will she be able to be independent by using helpful tools such as a daily pill organizer?</li>
      <li>Can she be trusted to take her medication? </li>
      <li>Does the young adult understand the importance of staying on their medication?</li>
      <li>Will technology be helpful as a way to remind him to take his medications?</li>
      <li>What supports have been put in place? Are there additional supports needed?</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Health care financing: </strong>Does the individual need to continue on the family&rsquo;s insurance plan? Under the provisions of the Affordable Care Act, individuals can stay on the family plan until age 26, and some insurance plans allow adult children with disabilities or special health care needs to remain on their parents&rsquo; plan for life.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Is the individual eligible for adult Medical Assistance based on disability or income?</li>
      <li>Is he or she eligible for Supplemental Security Income (SSI)? Many young adults are eligible depending on their resources and/or disability.</li>
      <li>Does he or she qualify for home and community based waivers that provide flexibility in selecting housing options in the community?</li>
      <li>Are there other state-specific resources or grants that might be available?</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Transfer as an integrated plan: </strong>There are multiple steps that take place in the transition process, and these need to be well-integrated.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Interview new adult providers with a support person, such as a parent, guardian or caregiver.</li>
      <li>Maintain the link with the current pediatrician to answer questions, provide information, and assist with interim communication with new providers.</li>
      <li>Have the young adult receive health care from both adult providers and his or her pediatrician during the transition process. This kind of collaborative care can make the transition go more smoothly for everyone involved.</li>
      <li>The pace of transition varies greatly. For some young adults it may be a more gradual process that could last a year or two, especially if multiple medical specialists are involved in the delivery of care. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Changes that occur during transfer from pediatric to adult health care systems: </strong>There are many changes that take place during this period. For example, some pediatric specialties may not have an equivalent in adult health care, such as a developmental behavioral pediatrician or the unique family care provided in a children&rsquo;s hospital.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Will the individual attend appointments alone? If not, who will accompany her?&nbsp; </li>
      <li>How will information about the individual be communicated to medical personnel?</li>
      <li>How will information from health care providers be implemented by the individual?</li>
      <li>How will compliance be ensured?</li>
      <li>How will the family or guardian stay informed about their youth&rsquo;s health care needs? </li>
      <li>What role will technology play in this process?</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Checklists for transition readiness</strong>: It&rsquo;s important to begin the process early to reduce the number of surprises along the way. At times, certain steps may need to be repeated or updated. Some of the basic checklist items include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Making appointments</li>
      <li>Health insurance</li>
      <li>Medical history, one-page summary, medical binder</li>
      <li>Prescriptions<br />
        <em>(See <a href="/health/For-Medical-Professionals/PRTP-Toolkit/pdfs/Appendix-10.pdf" target="_blank">Appendix 10</a> and <a href="/health/For-Medical-Professionals/PRTP-Toolkit/pdfs/Appendix-11.pdf" target="_blank">Appendix 11</a>)</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Develop a health transition plan:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Determine the individual&rsquo;s short- and long-term goals for independent living and employment while respecting each family&rsquo;s unique cultural perspective.</li>
      <li>Assess the youth&rsquo;s health care understanding early in the planning process. This will empower the youth to be more involved, and increase the opportunity for him or her to obtain a set of skills in the future.</li>
      <li>Set up a health transition plan with the family and their youth or young adult to acquire the skills they will need in the future.</li>
      <li>The health transition plan should identify skills that the parent and youth can include into his or her Individualized Education Program (IEP). The transition goals in the IEP can be connected to medical transition needs. For example, if a student needs to learn how to keep appointments, the IEP could include a goal of arriving to class on time as a way to reinforce that skill. </li>
      <li>Every visit is an opportunity to assess skill level on goals and determine if new resources are needed.<br />

<h4>b. Transfer from high school to post-secondary education, vocational school or employment</h4>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This section looks at the individual&rsquo;s abilities, goals, and future plans after the young adult graduates from high school, and how she or he will achieve those goals.</p>
    <ol type="I">
      <li>What is his level of functioning, and what kind of activities is he able to participate in?
        <ol type="i">
          <li>Post-secondary education: Is the individual interested in pursuing post-secondary education? In what setting might that occur, and with what supports and services?
            <ul>
              <li>How are the individual&rsquo;s organizational skills?</li>
              <li>Are there disability services available on campus?</li>
              <li>Is the student able to order medications or carry an insurance card?</li>
              <li>Will she be able to make and keep appointments?</li>
              <li>Is there a role for technology to assist with developing organizational skills and assisting with compliance?</li>
              <li>Who will be the support staff and emergency contacts if there is a medical problem or some other unexpected event?</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Will the young adult pursue further education, such as community college, a job training program, or training for a technical certificate?</li>
          <li>Is the individual able to work? If so, it needs to be established what type of jobs are a good fit, how many hours the young adult is able to work, and what types of supports might be needed in a work environment.
            <ul>
              <li>Is the individual eligible for vocational rehabilitation services?</li>
              <li>Is he eligible for county supported employment through Medicaid?</li>
              <li>Will she need a job coach to be successful?</li>
            </ul>

          <li>Is the young adult interested in a day program?</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Transition planning as part of the Individualized Education Program (IEP) process:
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>What prior planning does the IEP team need to do in order to prepare the student for life after high school, including post-secondary education, work, independent living, and assuming responsibility for their own health care? <em>(see <a href="/health/For-Medical-Professionals/PRTP-Toolkit/pdfs/Appendix-13.pdf" target="_blank">Appendix 13</a> for a list of potential IEP goals and objectives)</em></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

  <h4>c. Dependence on family to independence in the community</h4>
  <p>This section identifies the youth or young adult&rsquo;s areas of dependence and explores the transition services needed for youth and their families.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Accessing services:</strong> Until age 18, family members and other adults have been responsible for locating information and services for their young child with special health care needs and disabilities. As youth and young adults begin to plan further transition, these expectations of families may change.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Who will be responsible for arranging the individual&rsquo;s care?</li>
      <li>What responsibilities will the young adult have? What will have to be done by others?</li>
      <li>Who will identify community resources for the youth or young adult such as Parent Training Centers, Independent Living Centers, and Family-to-Family Health Information Centers? </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Housing:</strong> Where will the young adult live? </p>
    <ul>
      <li>What are the youth&rsquo;s goals and attitudes toward future housing? </li>
      <li>Is the family proactively developing a plan for future housing needs?</li>
      <li>Will the family choose to have their adult child live at home for a period of time?</li>
      <li>Are group homes and more individualized settings such as adapted apartments available in the community?</li>
      <li>How does housing need to be customized to fit the individual&rsquo;s needs for the least restrictive environment, including physical accommodations such as lower counters, and other modifications?</li>
      <li>See PACER&rsquo;s resources at <a href="http://www.pacer.org/housing/" target="_blank">PACER.org/housing</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Transition to new in-home care staff: </strong>There are a number of services available to support youth with special health care needs and disabilities. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Will the young adult need a personal care attendant (PCA), service support professional (SSP), or nursing staff to provide support for independent living? </li>
      <li>Could other support staff deliver such services as cooking, personal care, and budgeting or money management to assist with the transition from dependence on family members to more independent living?</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Transportation: </strong>It&rsquo;s important to look realistically at how a young adult making the transition to more independent living will travel to appointments, a place of employment, or community activities.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Does the young adult have a driver&rsquo;s license? If not, has an assessment been done to determine if he or she has the ability to operate a car safely, with or without adaptations?</li>
      <li>Is the individual able to use public transportation? </li>
      <li>Is he or she eligible for adapted mobility services?</li>
      <li>Does he use medical transportation through Medical Assistance?</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Decision making: </strong>Until age 18, an individual&rsquo;s parents or guardian make all of the important decisions. After age 18, the individual will need to sign an official Consent for Release of Information form if a court-appointed guardian is not in place.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Will the individual be able to make medical, financial, or legal decisions independently, or does the family need to obtain legal guardianship prior to his or her 18th birthday? </li>
      <li>Similar decisions will need to be made regarding conservatorship, power of attorney, and advance health care directives.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Self-care and chronic condition management:</strong> What self-care skills does the young adult need, and what is he or she able to do?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Can the individual perform basic activities of daily living such as dressing, grooming, and feeding? </li>
      <li>Can she manage her place of residence and do her own cooking, cleaning, and laundry?</li>
      <li>Is he capable of managing his own finances?</li>
      <li>Can he or she comply with a medication regimen?</li>
      <li>Is the young adult able to make and keep appointments?</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Communications:</strong> How effectively is the individual &nbsp;able to communicate his or her needs and have those needs met? At the age of transition, family dynamics tend to change and some young adults may have difficulty expressing their desire for more independence.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Is there a support network in place for the individual and his or her parents?</li>
      <li>Is there assistive technology available that will enable the young adult to communicate more effectively, or function more independently?</li>
    </ul>

<h2>E. TIMELINE</h2>
  <p>There are many different factors that will impact the development of a Pediatric Resident Program, and no two situations are alike. The following is a suggested timeline for establishing and growing a Pediatric Resident Training Program.</p>
  <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Year 1:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>First, identify a medical partner and agree on program goals and objectives, and evaluation tools.</li>
        <li>Identify a community partner that can refer and train parents of youth with special health care needs. Establish an agreement to work together.</li>
        <li>Contact PACER Center for guidance, questions, or advice if there is interest in establishing this program (e-mail <a href="mailto:pacer@pacer.org">pacer@pacer.org</a> or call 952-838-9000)</li>
        <li>Establish curriculum items and resources (paper and web-based).</li>
        <li>Train staff.</li>
        <li>Train parents.</li>
        <li>Seek opportunities to recruit diverse families.</li>
        <li>Conduct a pilot program with residents and families.</li>
        <li>Utilize PACER&rsquo;s evaluation process and tools.</li>
      </ul>
    <p><strong>Year 2:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Train additional families.</li>
      <li>Host annual education event for families.</li>
      <li>Establish resources to link from website.</li>
      <li>Evaluate curriculum.</li>
      <li>Assess program outcomes.</li>
      <li>Establish and maintain listserv for participants who have been trained.</li>
      <li>Distribute follow-up surveys to evaluate effectiveness.</li>
      <li>Continue collaboration with defined partners.</li>
      <li>Program implementation, continued monthly orientation, family visits, and debriefing.</li>
      <li>Send information about your project to PACER Center: 8161 Normandale Blvd.&nbsp; Bloomington, MN 55437 or e-mail <a href="mailto:pacer@pacer.org">pacer@pacer.org</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Year 3:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Consider forming a medical advisory board, or inviting medical professionals to join the organization&rsquo;s advisory board, to provide input and feedback on the program.</li>
      <li>Collaborate with other Pediatric Resident Training Programs to gather new resources.</li>
      <li>Continue program implementation.</li>
      <li>Look for expansion opportunities.</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>

<h2>F. TIPS FOR SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Consider terminology:</strong> Language varies from culture to culture. Staff should seek input from diverse families on vocabulary used in the curriculum and resources that are provided to parents and residents. The use of certain language may impact a family&rsquo;s perception of the program and could affect their decision on whether or not to participate.&nbsp; </li>
  <li><strong>Focus on the family, not the place:</strong> Program terminology was changed from &ldquo;home visit&rdquo; to &ldquo;family visit&rdquo; because some families may not be comfortable with residents visiting their home. This subtle change helped residents and families consider other, more comfortable meeting locations in the community. </li>
  <li><strong>Look at opportunities to add diverse families:</strong> It is important that diverse families participate in the program. Cultural liaisons helped identify families to attend events and be introduced to the program. PACER multicultural staff facilitated initial family visits, provided training for the families, and helped build the relationship with Pediatric Resident Training Program staff. Multilingual resources and information are also helpful.</li>
  <li><strong>Empower families through information:</strong> One way PACER was able to encourage parent and family involvement was by consistently finding ways to enhance each family&rsquo;s knowledge and leadership opportunities.&nbsp; </li>
  <li><strong>Provide a stipend or reimbursement</strong>: Most families are willing to participate in the resident visits regardless of the financial incentive, but the stipend is a nice way to thank participants for the important role they are playing as teachers and the value of the time they are spending with residents.</li>
</ul>

<h2>DEFINITIONS</h2>
  <p><strong>Children and Youth with Special Health Care Needs:</strong> The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) defines as: &quot;Those who have or are at increased risk for a chronic physical, development, behavioral, or emotional condition, and who also require health and related services of a type or amount beyond that required by children generally.&rdquo;</p>
  <p><strong>Family- and Patient-Centered Care:</strong> The <a href="http://www.fv-ncfpp.org/quality-health-care1/family-centered-care/#F1" target="_blank">National Center for Family Professional Partnerships</a> says &ldquo;Family-centered care assures the health and well-being of children and their families through a respectful family-professional partnership. It honors the strengths, cultures, traditions and expertise that everyone brings to this relationship. Family-centered care is the standard of practice which results in high quality services.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The <a href="http://www.ipfcc.org/faq.html" target="_blank">Institute for Family-Centered Care</a> says &ldquo;Patient- and family-centered care is an approach to the planning, delivery, and evaluation of health care that is grounded in mutually beneficial partnerships among health care providers, patients, and families. It redefines the relationships in health care. Patient- and family-centered practitioners recognize the vital role that families play in ensuring the health and well-being of infants, children, adolescents, and family members of all ages. They acknowledge that emotional, social, and developmental support are integral components of health care. They promote the health and well-being of individuals and families and restore dignity and control to them. Patient- and family-centered care is an approach to health care that shapes policies, programs, facility design, and staff day-to-day interactions. It leads to better health outcomes and wiser allocation of resources, and greater patient and family satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>
  <p><strong>Medical Home:</strong> According to the <a href="http://www.medicalhomeinfo.org/" target="_blank">National Center for Medical Home Implementation</a>, &ldquo;A family-centered medical home is not a building, house, hospital, or home healthcare service, but rather an approach to providing comprehensive primary care. In a family-centered medical home, the pediatric care team works in partnership with a child and a child's family to assure that all of the medical and non-medical needs of the patient are met. Through this partnership the pediatric care team can help the family/patient access, coordinate, and understand specialty care, educational services, out-of-home care, family support, and other public and private community services that are important for the overall health of the child and family.&rdquo;</p>
