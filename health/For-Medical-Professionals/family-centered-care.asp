<h2>Family-Centered Care</h2>
<div id="mainDescriptionWrapper">
<div id="mainDescription">
	<p>Patient- and family-centered care is an approach to the  planning, delivery, and evaluation of health care that is grounded in mutually  beneficial partnerships among health care providers, patients, and families. It  redefines the relationships in health care.<br />
		Patient- and family-centered practitioners recognize the  vital role that families play in ensuring the health and well-being of infants,  children, adolescents, and family members of all ages. They acknowledge that  emotional, social, and developmental supports are integral components of health  care. They promote the health and well-being of individuals and families and  restore dignity and control to them.</p>
	<p>		Patient- and family-centered care is an approach to health  care that shapes policies, programs, facility design, and staff day-to-day  interactions. It leads to better health outcomes and wiser allocation of  resources, and greater patient and family satisfaction. The core concepts are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Respect and dignity</strong>. Health care practitioners  listen to and honor patient and family perspectives and choices. Patient and  family knowledge, values, beliefs and cultural backgrounds are incorporated  into the planning and delivery of care.</li>
		<li><strong>Information Sharing</strong>. Health care  practitioners communicate and share complete and unbiased information with  patients and families in ways that are affirming and useful. Patients and  families receive timely, complete, and accurate information in order to  effectively participate in care and decision-making.</li>
		<li><strong>Participation.</strong> Patients and families  are encouraged and supported in participating in care and decision-making at  the level they choose.</li>
		<li><strong>Collaboration.</strong> Patients and families  are also included on an institution-wide basis. Health care leaders collaborate  with patients and families in policy and program development, implementation,  and evaluation; in health care facility design; and in professional education,  as well as in the delivery of care.</li>
		</ul>
	<p>		<strong>Medical Professionals can consider:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Do  I believe that patients and family members bring unique perspectives and  expertise to the clinical relationship?</li>
		<li>Do  I work to create an environment in which patients and families feel supported  enough to speak freely?</li>
		<li>Do  I listen respectfully to the opinions of patients and family members?</li>
		<li>Do  I encourage patients and family members to participate in decision-making about  their care?<br />
		</li>
	</ul>
