        Face-to-face reassessments are scheduled annually.  DHS will send a letter of notification to PCA recipients explaining the reassessment process.   If the recipient&rsquo;s medical or behavioral status changes prior to the annual review date, contact the county Disability services office and ask to speak with a person regarding reassessing PCA services.</p>
          <p>Remember, you have the right to appeal any decision (whether termination or reduction of PCA services) within 30 days of receiving a decision from DHS. You may also request to have a Long-term Care Consultation (LTCC) at your reassessment to help you identify other services to meet your needs.</p>
