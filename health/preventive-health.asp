    <p>Children and youth with disabilities and special health care needs benefit from health care and health programs for the same reasons everyone does &ndash; to stay well, active, and a part of the community &ndash; and there is a lot that parents can do to help maintain and improve their child&rsquo;s health. This page offers information that parents of children with disabilities and special health care needs can use to help the whole family live a healthier lifestyle.</p>
    <h3>Prevention and Health Care</h3>
    <p>Children with disabilities and special health care needs can benefit from a holistic approach to health care, one that meets their needs as a whole person, not just as a person with a disability or special health care need. That means having the tools and information to make healthy choices and the knowledge to prevent illness.</p>
    <ul>
     <li>The <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/index.html" target="_blank">Affordable Care Act of 2010</a>, a federal law that reforms health care, requires that many preventive services be provided at no cost. These benefits are being implemented gradually, so ask your health plan for more information. Read more about these services at <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/prevention/children/index.html" target="_blank">HealthCare.gov</a></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li>In addition to general prevention, the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/HealthyLiving/" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a> website includes healthy living information for people with many conditions.</li>
     <li>The American Academy of Pediatrics <a href="http://www.healthychildren.org/English/Pages/default.aspx">Healthy Children</a> website includes a variety of articles and resources on prevention, such as:</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <ul>
      <li>The latest <a href="http://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/Recommended-Immunization-Schedules.aspx" target="_blank">immunization schedules</a> for children and youth</li>
      <li>Material on <a href="http://www.healthychildren.org/English/family-life/health-management/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">yearly check-up visits and managing your child&rsquo;s health care</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Developmental information</a> for all ages and stages of childhood</li>
     </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>Prevention and Active Living</h3>
    <p>The Affordable Care Act also emphasizes the community&rsquo;s role in promoting active living as a way to prevent disease. Many communities in Minnesota are working on wellness and recreation policies and on creating opportunities for families and children with and without disabilities. These projects make it easier for families to include physical activity in daily routines such as walking or biking for transportation or recreation, playing in the park, working in the yard, or using recreation facilities. </p>

    </ul>
    <h3>Prevention and Related Topics</h3>
    <p>Many chronic conditions and special  health care needs can be managed so that they have minimal impact on a child&rsquo;s  daily living. In some cases, it can help to know that higher risks for health  problems related to a disability or chronic condition can be managed.</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/obesity.html" target="_blank">Reducing Obesity</a> &ndash; A report from the Centers for Disease Control: <em>Achieving Healthy Weight by Reducing Obesity and Improving       Well-being for People with Disabilities across the Life Course</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Social inclusion can be defined as  being involved in activities, developing and maintaining relationships, and  having a sense of belonging. Many children with disabilities and special health  care needs learn, work, and live in inclusive settings, but too often they have  little social connection to, and few friendships with, those around them. Social  inclusion is an important component of social/emotional health, life choices,  and community participation.</p>

    <p>Children and youth with certain  disabilities or special health care needs may require specialized dental care,  or may be at higher risk for dental problems.</p>
