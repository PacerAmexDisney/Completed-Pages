  <h1>Prescription Assistance</h1>
  <p><img src="images/prescriptionpillbottle.png" alt="" width="95" height="100" hspace="12" align="right" /><strong>What is prescription assistance?</strong><br />
    Prescription assistance is help in paying for your or your  child&rsquo;s medications. Whether you are already receiving some insurance coverage  for medications or you do not have any prescription drug coverage, there are  programs to apply for and actions you can take if you struggle to pay for  medications.</p>
  <p><strong>How do I know what my  current insurance will cover for prescriptions?</strong><br />
    The first step to getting help  with the cost of your prescriptions is to understand your current prescription  coverage. If you have private insurance, look at your health care insurance  policy or summary plan description to find out if you have prescription  coverage and what the conditions of the coverage are. Some insurance plans  cover both medical care and prescriptions, and sometimes the medical care  insurance plan may be separate from the prescription insurance plan.<br />
    If you are covered by public  insurance (Medical Assistance, TEFRA, MinnesotaCare, or Medicare), then your  insurance may or may not cover your medications. Call the customer service  number on the back of your insurance card to ask for the conditions of your  prescription coverage in writing.<br />
    The next step is to understand the conditions of your  prescription insurance. Conditions within your plan might include:&nbsp; purchasing the generic rather than brand name  medication unless specified by your physician, paying a set fee per medication  or a percentage co-pay, annual caps or deductibles on medication costs, and/or  coverage limits. Knowing these conditions can help you work with your doctor to  lower the cost of medications.</p>
  <p><strong>How do I get  prescription assistance?</strong><br />
    Whether or not you have prescription insurance, it is  important to talk to your doctor about how to lower the cost of prescriptions.  Ask your doctor:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>If he or she has samples       of the medication</li>
    <li>If he or she can prescribe       the medication on a trial period or for samples if it is a new medication       you are taking</li>
    <li>If he or she can prescribe       the medication for a longer period of time so that you can buy the       medication in a larger quantity, which might be cheaper (Even if you are       taking a long-term medication, you can still ask your doctor for samples!)</li>
    <li>If you can try a generic       or therapeutic alternative medication instead of the brand name medication</li>
    <li>If your physician has a       connection with the drug manufacturer and can help in contacting the       manufacturer about reducing the cost of the medication</li>
    <li>If he or she can write       letters to your insurance company or to a Patient Assistance Program, to       advocate on your behalf</li>
    <li>If he or she can help you       fill out forms for applications to Patient Assistance Programs (Many of       the applications require at least your doctor&rsquo;s signature.)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In addition to working with your  doctor, you can apply for prescription assistance through public insurance  and/or Patient Assistant Programs. The Minnesota Department of Human Services  has <a href="http://www.dhs.state.mn.us/main/idcplg?IdcService=GET_DYNAMIC_CONVERSION&amp;RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased&amp;dDocName=dhs16_138241" target="_blank">information  on prescription assistance</a> for people already enrolled in MN Health Care  programs and has information on <a href="http://www.dhs.state.mn.us/main/idcplg?IdcService=GET_DYNAMIC_CONVERSION&amp;RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased&amp;dDocName=dhs16_144345" target="_blank">how  to apply for MN Health Care programs</a>.<br />
    <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/part-d/index.html" target="_blank">Medicare Plan D</a> is another public insurance  plan option and is available to anyone currently receiving Medicare Plan A or  B. Medicare Plan D has several different plan options, so make sure you  understand the plan you select.<br />
    You also have the option of  applying for Patient Assistance Programs.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  <strong>What is a Patient  Assistance Program (PAP)?</strong><br />
    A Patient Assistance Programs (PAPs) are programs that offer  free or reduced cost medications to low income, uninsured, or underinsured  individuals. They are offered individually through the manufacturing companies  that make and distribute the drugs. </p>
  <p><strong>What are the  eligibility requirements for a PAP?</strong><br />
    Eligibility requirements vary between PAPs. Some PAPs accept  people who are insured or receive Medicare, and some require that you have no  insurance. Check the eligibility requirements of the particular PAP before  applying.</p>
  <p><strong>Where and how do I  apply for a PAP?</strong><br />
    Several websites and help lines now can assist you in  finding and applying for PAPs. Check out the <a href="#resourcelinks">Resource Links</a> at the bottom of the page to be directed to these websites. The Resource Link  list is not an inclusive list of all online prescription assistance resources.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  <strong>What is the  difference between brand name, generic, and therapeutic alternative  medications?</strong><br />
    When medications are developed,  they are given a brand name and a generic name. A manufacturer is given the  patent for the brand name medication and is the only company allowed to sell  that drug under that name. Brand name medications have patent protection for a  certain amount of time.<br />
    A generic medication has the  same active ingredients in the same quantities as the brand name drug, but is  produced by other manufacturers after the brand name medication patent  protection has run out. Competition among the manufacturers can then drive down  the cost.<br />
    A therapeutic alternative  medication has different chemical levels but the similar effects as the brand  name or generic medications.</p>
