        <p>A  medical home is not a building, house, or hospital, but a better,  family-centered way to provide care for children with special health care needs  and disabilities. In a medical home, a pediatrician or family practice  physician coordinates care to make sure your child receives all the medical and  non-medical services needed.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
  <strong>Why is a medical home important?</strong></p>
        <p>As a  parent of a child with disabilities or chronic health conditions, you know that  working and communicating with many doctors, nurses, and other health,  education, insurance, and social service professionals can be difficult. Your  child and your family can benefit from a family-centered, teamwork approach for  providing care. Most importantly, a medical home can improve your child&rsquo;s  health.</p>
        <p><strong>How does a medical home work?</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong></p>
        <p>In a  medical home, information and concerns are shared by everyone caring for your  child. Needs are addressed in a coordinated way, with a primary care doctor and  their clinical staff serving as a coordinator of your medical home team. A  written care plan is shared with your family and all of your child&rsquo;s health  care providers.</p>
        <p>To build  a medical home, first choose a pediatrician, a specialist, or a family practice  doctor you trust to coordinate your medical home team. This doctor will be your  primary care doctor who will partner with you to:</p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>Coordinate care for your       child</li>
          <li>Develop care plans</li>
          <li>Communicate with other       professionals</li>

          <li>Exchange  information</li>

          <li>Share decision making</li>
          <li>Promote health and quality       of life for the child and family</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>What are the roles and duties  within a medical home?</strong></p>
        <p>The  primary care physician and other health care providers:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Know  the child&rsquo;s health history </li>
          <li>Listen  to the parents&rsquo; and child&rsquo;s concerns and needs </li>
          <li>Work  in partnership with families to ensure that the medical and non-medical needs  of the child and family are met </li>
          <li>Create  a trusting, collaborative relationship with the family </li>
          <li>Treat  the child with compassion and understanding </li>
          <li>Develop  a care plan with the family for their child when needed </li>
          <li>Share  impartial and complete information on an ongoing basis</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The  parents and child: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Are  comfortable sharing concerns and questions with the child&rsquo;s primary care  physician and other health care providers </li>
          <li>Routinely  communicate their child&rsquo;s needs and family priorities to the primary care physician,  who promotes communication between the family and other health care providers  when needed</li>
          <li>Feel  comfortable asking for things to be explained differently when they don&rsquo;t  understand</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>A medical home physician ensures  care that is:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Accessible: </em>&nbsp;Care is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a  week in the child&rsquo;s community.</li>
          <li><em>Family-Centered:</em>&nbsp;  Recognition that the family is the principal caregiver and the center of  strength and support for children</li>
          <li><em>Continuous:</em>&nbsp;  Same primary pediatric health care professionals are available from  infancy through adolescence. </li>
          <li><em>Comprehensive:&nbsp; </em>Includes  sick and well care as well as education and community referral needs</li>
          <li><em>Coordinated:</em>&nbsp;  Families are linked to support, educational, and community-based  services. </li>
          <li><em>Compassionate: </em>&nbsp;Concern for well-being of child and family is  expressed and demonstrated. </li>
          <li><em>Culturally effective:</em>&nbsp;  Family&rsquo;s cultural background is recognized, valued, and respected.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>What are the benefits of a  medical home?</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>More  organized care<strong></strong></li>
          <li>More  efficient communication &ndash; families don&rsquo;t have to repeat information to multiple  caregivers<strong></strong></li>
          <li>Support  from a team of caregivers <strong></strong></li>
          <li>Exams  scheduled in a coordinated, efficient way without duplicated services<strong></strong></li>
          <li>Improved  health care for your child<strong></strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>How do I build a medical home?</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Discuss  ways to improve your child&rsquo;s care and how to begin setting up a medical home  with your doctor or other care providers.</li>
