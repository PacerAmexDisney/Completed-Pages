				<h3>Samtra K. Devard: Morning Keynote Speaker</h3>
				<p>

Samtra is a devoted advocate for children with special needs and their families. She is particularly interested in advocating for systems change.

				</p>
				<h3 style="padding: 0; margin: 0;">Topic</h3>
				<h4 style="padding: 0; margin: 0; border: none;">"The Family Voice: The Currency of Family Leadership"</h4>
				<p>
				The intent of using money as a metaphor is that we all understand the value of money. A family&#8217;s experiences on their journey raising a child with special needs are what add value to systems change efforts. Samtra will speak about how important it is to recognize that value and how to shape your message and efforts in a constructive way. She will share experiences and challenges she has faced in Delaware working with the Parent Leadership Initiative and from her personal journey as a parent of a child with special needs.

				<h5>Creating Partnerships within Cultural Contexts: Strategies that Work</h5>

				Currently agencies providing supports for families with children and youth with disabilities and/or special health care needs are experiencing the effects of significant demographic changes within communities.
