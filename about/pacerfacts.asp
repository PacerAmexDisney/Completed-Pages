<h3 class="nounderline"><a name="2">What is PACER's mission?</a></h3>
<p>
PACER Center enhances the quality of life and expands opportunities for children, youth, and young adults with all disabilities and their families so each person can reach his or her highest potential. PACER operates on the principles of parents helping parents, supporting families, promoting a safe environment for all children, and working in collaboration with others.</p>

<h3 class="nounderline"><a name="3">Is PACER a 501(c)(3) organization?</a></h3>
<p>
Yes, PACER Center is a nonprofit organization serving children and youth with disabilities throughout the state of Minnesota and the nation. You can find a report on 
the organization at the 
<a href="http://www.smartgivers.org/">Minnesota Charities Review Council</a>. Gifts to PACER Center are tax-deductible as allowed by law.

<h3 class="nounderline"><a name="4">How is PACER connected to the community?</a></h3>
<p>
PACER Center is unique in that it serves children with <strong>all</strong> disabilities; learning, physical, emotional, mental and health. No other organization in Minnesota offers this broad range of service to families. PACER also works in coalition with 18 disability organizations. 
</p>
<p>
Many of PACER's board members are parent representatives from the coalition organizations. 
</p>
<p>
PACER's vision is to build a healthy, integrated community in which people learn to respect each other for what they have in common, and to celebrate their differences.

<h3 class="nounderline"><a name="6">How will my contribution help PACER Center?</a></h3>
<p>
Currently there are more than 200,000 children with special needs in Minnesota and 
6.7 million throughout the nation. Each year, PACER receives more requests for services that help children with all disabilities. Yet PACER is not a United Way agency, and does not charge workshop fees to parents of children with disabilities because PACER knows those parents are already facing high costs as they strive the meet the needs of their son or daughter with a disability. Your support will therefore help PACER staff respond to the ever-increasing number of families and professionals who contact PACER for assistance. </p>
