<!--BEGIN CONTENT-->

<p>
When PACER was established in 1977, it began with one project: 
<a href="../parent/index.asp">Parents Helping Parents</a>. Then as now, PACER was staffed primarily by parents of children with disabilities dedicated to educating other parents and improving the lives of children with disabilities throughout Minnesota. With a small grant from the Minnesota Department of Education, PACER conducted a five-month pilot project and demonstrated the effectiveness of the "parents helping parents" model. 
</p>
<p>
Although today PACER offers more than <a href="../pandr/index.asp">30 programs</a> for parents, students, professionals and other parent organizations, the original philosophy of "parents helping parents" remains the foundation upon which PACER has grown. Whether addressing the issues of early childhood or assisting youth in making the transition from high school to work, parents on PACER's staff share their experiences and their knowledge with others so that all Minnesota's children with disabilities may have a better future.</p>
<p>
A look at the past 30 years shows the commitment and some of the accomplishments of PACER friends, boards and other volunteers and staff who have worked hard to make a difference in the lives of children with disabilities and their families.
