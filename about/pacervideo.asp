<h3>Seeing the Future</h3>
<p>
I have a disability.
</p>
<p>
You see me every day.
</p>
<p>
You see me in the crowd...
</p>
<p>
at work...
</p>
<p>
or maybe the store.
</p>
<p>
You see me every day.
</p>
<p>
I have a disability.
</p>
<p>
You see me every day.
</p>
<p>
This is Tomás.<br />
You see him every day.
</p>
<p>
Tomás has a learning disability in math.<br />
<strong>TOMÁS:</strong> I work in a coffee house, and I'm also a student at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design.
</p>
<p>
This is Amber.<br />
You see her every day.
</p>
<p>
Amber has a cognitive delay.<br />
<strong>AMBER:</strong> I go to Normandale Community College. I want to be a writer.
</p>
<p>
<strong>(Frank Vascellaro - narrator):</strong> Every day, people with disabilities touch our lives, and ever day, PACER Center touches the lives of people with disabilities.
PACER is a training and information center for parents of children and youth with any disability -- whether it's a learning disability, ADHD, a physical impairment, or a mental health challenge.
For almost three decades, PACER has expanded opportunities and enriched the lives of children and their families.
PACER programs and services help people to have dreams for their lives -- right from the beginning.
PACER's Early Childhood Project, for example, can help families find intervention services from the moment their child with disabilities is born.
Early Intervention gives babies and young children the best start for a bright future.
PACER's Parents Helping Parent Program is a lifeline for many families.
Just a phone call puts parents in touch with a PACER staff person who can help them address concerns about their child with a disability.
Last year, PACER received more than 38,000 calls from parents and other seeking information and assistance.
PACER's Simon Technology Center offers many programs that help children with disabilities communicate, participate, and graduate to exciting futures.
For example, at EX.I.T.E. Camp, sponsored in part by IBM, middle-school girls with disabilities have fun with hands-on experiments while they explore potential careers in science and technology.
When children become young adults, PACER is still there.
A variety of transition programs help young adults with disabilities pursue additional education, prepare for work, and find living accommodations.<br /><br />
<strong>TOMÁS:</strong> My parents called PACER when I was eight. PACER taught them how to advocate for me. Then, when I was older they taught me how to advocate for myself.<br />
<br />
<strong>(Frank):</strong> Through more than 30 programs, hundreds of workshops, and thousands of outreach efforts, PACER has earned state and national respect. Only 11% of PACER's budget is spent on administration and fundraising. That means an outstanding amount goes directly to programs serving families.
From birth through young adulthood, PACER brings the future into focus for children with disabilities. <br /><br />
Sam has Down syndrome.<br />
<strong>SAM'S MOM:</strong> This is Sam. You are going to be seeing him. He's really interested in books, animals, and animal crackers! We think he's going to be working at the zoo or the library.<br />
<br />
Michelle has limited hearing.<br />
<strong>MICHELLE:</strong> I'm Michelle, and you'll be seeing me! I want to take pictures of nature, people, flowers, friends, and family. I don't care who I take picture for as long as I can take pictures.
</p>
<p>
<strong>(Frank):</strong> This is Jarek. You'll be seeing him. He wants to design 
buildings.<br />
Jarek has cerebral palsy.<br />
<br />
<strong>JAREK:</strong> I would like to design a hotel with programmed butlers. PACER lets you use your imagination.<br /><br />
<strong>(Frank):</strong> Because of PACER, you'll be seeing Jarek -- and a lot of other people with imagination -- every day...every day...every day!<br />
<br />
<strong>MICHELLE:</strong> Thank you, PACER!<br /><br />
<strong>LAUREN:</strong>
Thank you, PACER!<br /><br />
<strong>TOMÁS:</strong> Gracias, PACER!<br /><br />
<strong>SAM'S MOM:</strong> Thank you.<br />
<br />
<strong>AMBER:</strong> Thank you, PACER!<br /><br />
<strong>JAREK:</strong> Thank you, PACER!<br /><br /><br />
Thank you, PACER supporters.<br /><br />
