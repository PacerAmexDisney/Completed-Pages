<h2>Be a partner during National Bullying Prevention Month in October with PACER Center</h2>


<p><strong><em>Sept. 7 CNN report highlights event </em></strong></p>
<p>MINNEAPOLIS:&nbsp; PACER Center is inviting communities, organizations and schools across the country to become &ldquo;Partners&rdquo; or &ldquo;Champions&rdquo; of bullying prevention during National Bullying Prevention Month in October. The month is sponsored by PACER. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re urging organizations to become leaders of this important cause in their area,&rdquo; said Paula Goldberg, PACER&rsquo;s executive director. Organizations can sign on as partners or champions at <a href="http://www.PACER.org/bullying/">PACER.org/bullying</a>, where they will also find resources and ideas for bullying prevention activities.</p>
<p>To learn more about the month, people can view &ldquo;Standing Up to Bullying,&rdquo; a Sept. 7 CNN Newsroom interview of PACER spokesperson and Disney star Demi Lovato and PACER Board Member Michael Keller at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeGybzYtttY" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeGybzYtttY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeGybzYtttY</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;This event is about individuals, schools, and organizations uniting to raise awareness of an issue that directly impacts students and school culture,&rdquo; said Julie Hertzog, director PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center. &ldquo;Those who are bullied often feel that no one cares, so let's send the message that peers, adults and parents do care.&quot;<br />
 &nbsp;<strong> </strong><br />

They also have access to PACER&rsquo;s bullying prevention resources, including exciting new activities, information, and contests that will engage youth, educators, and parents in creating a safer world for children. <strong> </strong></p>
