<h1 align="center"><strong>Rebecca Black Named PACER Spokesperson</strong><br />
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size:.7em; font-weight:normal;">Teen pop star will represent PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center</span>
</h1>
<p>MINNEAPOLIS:&nbsp; Teen pop star  Rebecca Black, who rose to prominence in 2011 when the music video of her song  &ldquo;Friday&rdquo; became the most viewed video of the year on YouTube, has been named as  a spokesperson for <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying">PACER&rsquo;s  National Bullying Prevention Center</a>. The  15-year-old from Anaheim Hills,   Calif., will make public  appearances on behalf of PACER during National Bullying Prevention Month in  October, and she will speak out about bullying prevention throughout the year  in concerts, in the press, and on her social media sites where she has millions  of followers and over 270 million video views.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very excited that I can work with a great organization  like PACER,&rdquo; said Black. &ldquo;They are doing so much to help kids who are being  bullied at school and on the Internet, and I am going to do whatever I can to  make a difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Black recorded her first song &ldquo;Friday,&rdquo; and  filmed a video to accompany the song, she thought only her family and close  friends would hear the music and watch the video. Unbeknownst to her and her  family, the video was uploaded to YouTube and went viral. Within a few weeks,  Black was making numerous national television appearances and mainstream  artists such as Nick and Joe Jonas, Justin Bieber and Katy Perry were  performing the song at concerts. She was invited to perform &ldquo;Friday&rdquo; live on  stage with Perry and to co-star in Perry&rsquo;s video for &ldquo;Last Friday Night.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was named the Best Web Star at the 2011  Teen Choice Awards and was honored by &ldquo;Variety&rdquo; magazine. &ldquo;My Moment,&rdquo; Black's  second single, currently has over 35 million YouTube views.&nbsp; She has since released two more singles and  videos &ndash; &ldquo;Person of Interest&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sing It&rdquo; &ndash; and will soon be shooting her  next video for her fifth single titled &ldquo;In Your Words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bullying is something that affects so many and it can  happen to anyone. I know what it's like to have people make fun of you, and I  know how much it can hurt. I just don't want other kids to have to go through  that,&rdquo; said Black. </p>
<p>Black is helping to raise money for PACER with a  T-shirt she designed for National Bullying Prevention Month as part of the  second annual &ldquo;Be Good to Each Other&rdquo; campaign created by CustomInk, the  &ldquo;design online&rdquo; custom T-shirt company. The campaign takes a stand for kindness  and tolerance and uses the power of custom T-shirts to do good. Black&rsquo;s fans  can purchase her unique design at <a href="http://www.customink.com/stopbullying">CustomInk.com/stopbullying</a>, and all profits from the campaign support PACER.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted the T-shirt to have meaning and share the message  that we are all unique. I really enjoyed creating a design for this campaign  and am happy with how it came out,&rdquo; said Black, whose purple and orange  creation is a positive, inspiring play on the word 'Friday.' &ldquo;I think it says  what I believe &ndash; that you just need to be free and dare to be yourself. I'm  hoping all my fans will want to buy one and show their support against  bullying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julie Hertzog, director of PACER's National Bullying Prevention   Center, said the  organization is thrilled to have Black as a spokesperson. &ldquo;Rebecca is a  wonderful example of resilience and the importance of being true to yourself,&rdquo;  Hertzog said. &ldquo;She is a confident, successful young person who wants to support  other teens, and she is truly making a difference for her peers.&rdquo; PACER&rsquo;s free  bullying prevention resources are available at PACER.org/Bullying.</p>
