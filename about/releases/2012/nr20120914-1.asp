<span style="font-weight:normal; font-style:italic; font-size:.9em">Event kicks off National Bullying Prevention Month</span></h2>
<p><strong>Minneapolis</strong><strong>, MN:&nbsp;</strong> <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying">PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention  Center</a> is inviting the Minnesota community  to show support for students who are bullied at the third annual Run, Walk,  Roll Against Bullying on Saturday, Oct. 6, in Bloomington, Minn. </p>
<p>&ldquo;So many students feel that the adults in their lives are failing  to adequately address this issue,&rdquo; said Julie Hertzog, director of PACER&rsquo;s National  Bullying Prevention  Center based in Minneapolis, Minn.  &ldquo;Community-wide efforts like this show students that adults really do  want to help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>  The outdoor event kicks  off PACER&rsquo;s  National Bullying Prevention Month of October and offers an opportunity for  adults and students to help raise funds to support bullying prevention. <em>All proceeds from PACER&rsquo;s Run, Walk, Roll Against  Bullying will go to PACER's National   Bullying Prevention   Center. </em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;This is a great way for people to gather their  friends and family and do something positive for students who are bullied,&rdquo;  said Paula F. Goldberg, PACER Center&rsquo;s  executive director. &ldquo;Our National   Bullying Prevention   Center continues to  create helpful and cutting-edge resources that teach everyone how to prevent  bullying, and this event helps to make that possible.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>  Presented by  American Dairy Queen, the 4-mile run or 1.5-mile walk or roll will take place  at Mt. Normandale Lake, Normandale Blvd. and 84th St., Bloomington, Minn.  Registration is at 9 a.m., with the race starting at 10 a.m. Participants and  spectators will gather after the race at the Normandale Lake Bandshell for  entertainment, speakers, snacks, and family fun. </p>
<p>  The entry  fee is $20 per person for adults, $10 for ages 7 to 16, and includes a  complimentary event T-shirt. Children ages 6 and under are free.  Participants are encouraged to gather pledges from  family, friends, co-workers, and local businesses.
