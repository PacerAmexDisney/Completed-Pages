<h1 style="text-align:center; text-transform:none;">Communities Urged to Take Action During National Bullying Prevention Month in October<br />
<em style="font-size:.8em; font-weight:normal">PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center offers free web-based tools</em>
</h1>


<p>MINNEAPOLIS: Nearly one-third of all school-aged children are bullied each year - upwards of 13 million students. During National Bullying Prevention Month in October, communities are urged to come together and take action to send a message that bullying will not be accepted in their town or school.<br />
Founded by <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying">PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center</a> in October 2006, National Bullying Prevention Month is now a nationwide event recognized in schools and communities and supported by the National Education Association, the American Federation for Teachers and the National PTA among others. <br />
&ldquo;We all know what the research shows &ndash; that bullying can erode self-esteem, impact learning at school, cause anxiety and depression, and even lead to suicide,&rdquo; said Julie Hertzog, director of PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center based in Minneapolis, Minn., said. &ldquo;Many students do not feel adults are adequately addressing this issue. We&rsquo;re hoping that communities across the county will take action and respond to that concern this October, so students who are bullied know there&rsquo;s support and help in their town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Community members can take action in several ways: </p>
<ul>
 <li>Use the free online resources from PACER&rsquo;s National  Bullying Prevention  Center tailored to elementary and middle school kids, teens, parents, teachers and other adults and take a pledge to put an end to bullying (PACER.org/Bullying, PACERTeensAgainstBullying.org or PACERKidsAgainstBullying.org)</li>
 <li>Send a united message of support by wearing orange on <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/nbpm/unity-day.asp">Unity Day</a>, Wednesday, Oct. 10 to &ldquo;Make It Orange and Make It End.&rdquo;</li>
 <li>Become a &ldquo;partner or &ldquo;champion&rdquo; during National Bullying Prevention Month at <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/nbpm">PACER.org/bullying/nbpm</a> to actively spread the word and get others involved</li>
 <li>Help a student create a bullying prevention plan available at PACER.org/bullying/resources/publications/plan.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional details:</p>
<p><strong>Access Web-based tools</strong><br />
 Last year, 1.4 million people in nearly 200 countries used the National Bullying  Prevention Center&rsquo;s resources and web-based tools to plan events, activities, outreach and educational initiatives. Resources are available at PACER.org/bullying/resources. The tools are available on three websites: <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying">PACER.org/Bullying</a> for parents, teachers, and other adults; <a href="http://www.pacerteensagainstbullying.org">PACERTeensAgainstBullying.org</a> for teens; and <a href="http://www.pacerkidsagainstbullying.org">PACERKidsAgainstBullying.org</a> for elementary school students.</p>
<p><strong>Wear Orange on Unity Day</strong><br />
 &ldquo;Wearing orange on October 10th is a great way to make a powerful statement,&rdquo; said Paula F. Goldberg, PACER Center&rsquo;s executive director. &ldquo;Anyone can join with us to &ldquo;Make It Orange and Make It End.&rdquo; </p>
<p>To display the official color of National Bullying Prevention Month, students and adults can wear orange, hand out orange &ldquo;UNITY&rdquo; ribbons, write the word &ldquo;UNITY&rdquo; on their hands or school binders, and update their Facebook pages with a message from PACER.org/bullying. To order the official orange T-shirt of National Bullying Prevention Month and find other ways to &ldquo;Make It Orange and Make It End,&rdquo; visit <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/nbpm/unity-day-t-shirt.asp">PACER.org/bullying/nbpm/unity-day-t-shirt.asp.</a></p>
<p><strong>Make an Action Plan</strong><br />
 Educators working with a student who is being bullied, parents looking for ways to help their child, or students who wants to take action can download <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/resources/publications/">PACER&rsquo;s student action plan</a> at PACER.org/bullying/resources/publications/plan. The plan offers an opportunity for students &ndash; either on their own or with their parents and teachers &ndash; to develop their own bullying prevention strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Partners or Champions</strong><br />
 Organizations and individuals can also take an active role during National Bullying Prevention Month by visiting PACER.org/bullying/nbpm and choosing to be Partners or Champions during National Bullying Prevention Month, or signing the digital petition pledging, &ldquo;The End of Bullying Begins with Me,&rdquo; at PACER.org/bullying/digitalpetition. National partners of the month include the National Education Association, the American Federation for Teachers, the National PTA, and many others.<br />
