<h1 style="text-align:center; text-transform:none;"><strong>Unite Against Bullying on Unity Day, Oct. 10 </strong><br />
<em style="font-weight:normal; font-size:.8em;">Join PACER and &ldquo;Make It Orange and Make It End&rdquo;<br />
 during National Bullying Prevention Month</em></h1>
<p>MINNEAPOLIS:&nbsp; As a show of support to children who are bullied, <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying">PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center</a> invites everyone to wear orange on Unity Day, Wednesday, Oct. 10, during National Bullying Prevention Month. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly one-third of all school-aged children are bullied each year - upwards of 13 million students,&rdquo; said Julie Hertzog, director of PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center, which sponsors Unity Day and founded National Bullying Prevention Month in 2006. &ldquo;We need to show these students they are not alone. By joining together and wearing orange on Unity Day, we can send a national, unified message that bullying will no longer be accepted in this society.&rdquo; </p>
<p>There are many ways to support the cause:</p>
<p><strong>Wear a Celebrity-Designed, Customized or Official T-Shirt</strong><br />
 PACER is making it easy this year for everyone to wear orange &ndash; either a design of their own, one created by a celebrity or one created for them. Official National Bullying Prevention Month T-shirts for Unity Day will be available on the PACER website for a limited time. The website also features a section so anyone can customize an orange shirt. Individual or group orders can be made for any of the T-shirts, and all proceeds support the work of PACER&rsquo;s National  Bullying Prevention  Center, a nonprofit that provides free online bullying prevention resources. Look for details and ordering information at <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/nbpm/unity-day-t-shirt.asp">www.PACER.org/bullying/nbpm/unity-day-t-shirt.asp</a></p>
<p><strong>Share the Unity Message</strong><br />
 In addition to wearing orange, people can update their Facebook status to the Unity Day message at PACER.org/Bullying, visit the Unity Day Facebook page to &ldquo;Share&rdquo; and &ldquo;Attend&rdquo; the Unity Day Event, and post pictures of anyone wearing orange to PACER&rsquo;s Unity Day Facebook page. Students can also take part by distributing orange &ldquo;Unity&rdquo; ribbons and writing &ldquo;Unity&rdquo; on their hands or school binders. During Unity Day&rsquo;s debut in 2011, thousands of students, co-workers and even television personality Ellen DeGeneres spread the message of support by wearing orange, the official color of bullying prevention. </p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a great way to make a powerful statement,&rdquo; said Paula  F. Goldberg, PACER  Center&rsquo;s executive director. &ldquo;Anyone can join with us to &ldquo;Make It Orange and Make It End.&rdquo; </p>
<p>PACER is also partnering with Facebook on a new &ldquo;school event toolkit&rdquo; that will help students organize their own bullying prevention event. It&rsquo;s coming soon to PACER.org/Bullying.</p>
<p>PACER originated National Bullying Prevention Month in 2006. National partners of the month include the National Education Association, the American Federation for Teachers, the National PTA, and many others. Facebook is partnering with PACER by posting information about Unity Day and other PACER activities on its safety, educator, and privacy pages during October.<br />
 PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention  Center provides creative and interactive resources that are designed to benefit all students, including students with disabilities. It offers educators, students, families and individuals the tools they need to address bullying. For more information, visit PACER.org/Bullying or call 952-838-9000. </p>
