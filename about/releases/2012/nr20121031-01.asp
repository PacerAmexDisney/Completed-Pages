<h2>PACER Announces Unite Against Bullying Guide</h2>
<h4>Student event planning guide helps teens take action in the community </h4>
<p>MINNEAPOLIS:&nbsp; PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center with the support of Facebook, worked to develop a practical tool that students can use to hold bullying prevention events in their schools and communities. &ldquo;Unite Against Bullying: A Student Event Planning Guide&rdquo; is a step-by-step guide that helps teens plan, promote, and execute a variety of events designed to raise awareness of bullying prevention and generate support for the cause. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We are thrilled to have worked with Facebook to create a guide that enables students to amplify the bullying prevention message in a positive, proactive way,&rdquo; said Julie Hertzog, director of PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center. &ldquo;Student-led initiatives make a powerful statement to peers and the community that bullying is not acceptable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>October is National Bullying Prevention Month, which was originated by PACER in 2006, and students around the country are raising awareness through events, activities, outreach, and education. PACER provides a variety of resources that make it easier for students, parents, teachers, and members of the community at large to take action in October and throughout the year. By incorporating Facebook&rsquo;s built-in tools, such as groups and social plug-ins (&lsquo;likes&rsquo; for example), into the planning process students can more effectively organize events and maximize participation.</p>
<p>The Student Event Planning Guide is available for download from PACER.org/bullying. Facebook is supporting the project on its &ldquo;Stop Bullying: Speak Up&rdquo; page as well as on its Facebook in Education (https://www.facebook.com/education) and Facebook Safety (https://www.facebook.com/fbsafety) pages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;PACER is doing important work to prevent bullying across the country, and we&rsquo;re excited to be a part of this initiative to get students engaged in making bullying uncool,&rdquo; said Joel Kaplan, Facebook&rsquo;s Vice President for Public Policy. &ldquo;Students are doing so much to lead the bullying prevention movement and Facebook has a variety of tools they can use to speak up against bullying, and make a positive difference.&quot;</p>
<p>The guide encourages students to be leaders by showing that they care. It is written in student-friendly language and walks users through five steps to staging a successful bullying prevention event. The guide offers practical tips about logistics, suggests potential activities to incorporate into an event, and provides ways to use Facebook throughout the planning process. </p>
<p>&quot;This guide is a tool that both students and educators can use to get involved in their schools and communities,&quot; said Kaplan. &quot;One activity suggested in the guide is for students, as well as adults, to speak up and take the &lsquo;Stop Bullying: Speak Up&rsquo; pledge together. This pledge seeks to raise awareness of the simple yet powerful actions that students, parents, and educators can take to prevent bullying. Student-led events like the kind outlined in this guide are one way to do that.&rdquo; </p>
