<h2><strong>PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center  Wins at the Grammy Awards!</strong><br />
  <em>&ldquo;All About Bullies&hellip; Big and Small&rdquo; named Best  Children&rsquo;s Album</em></h2>



<p><strong>MINNEAPOLIS:</strong>&nbsp; When the Grammy Award for  Best Children&rsquo;s Album was presented Sunday in Los Angeles, PACER Center was one  of the winners. The CD &ldquo;All About Bullies&hellip; Big and Small&rdquo; received music&rsquo;s  highest award, and all proceeds from its sale go to support the mission of  PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center. The CD can be purchased at <a href="http://allaboutbulliesbigandsmall.com/" target="_blank">allaboutbulliesbigandsmall.com</a>.</p>
<p>  Producer  Steve Pullara, of Philadelphia&rsquo;s Cool Beans Music, gave a &lsquo;shout out&rsquo; to PACER  from the Grammy stage and again to the throng of international reporters  gathered for the event. &ldquo;This is incredible!&rdquo; said Pullara as he accepted the  Grammy on behalf of more than 20 artists who participated in the project. &ldquo;We  created this out of love. We have a lot of people here who all volunteered  their time and all of the money is going to <a href="http://www.PACERKidsAgainstBullying.org" target="_blank">PACERKidsAgainstBullying.org</a>.&rdquo;<br />
  </p>
<p>&ldquo;All  About Bullies&hellip; Big and Small&rdquo; features a unique mix of poems and songs about  bullies on the bus, cyberbullies, children who don&rsquo;t fit in, and children who  are learning to stand up for themselves. A common theme runs throughout as each  child finds a way to act differently, or to accept other children for who they  are. &ldquo;The CD creatively speaks to all children through music and poetry,&rdquo; said Julie  Hertzog, director of PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center. &ldquo;It offers a  beautiful way to educate children about the universal theme of treating one  another with kindness.&rdquo;<br />
  </p>
<p>More  than 160,000 children miss school every day out of fear of attack or  intimidation by other students. Children who are bullied are more likely to  develop depression and anxiety disorders that do not disappear at the end of  the school year. Doctors say the effects of bullying can last a lifetime. In  some cases, bullying can even lead to suicide. <br />
  &ldquo;We did  this to bring attention to bullying and here we are. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s unbelievable,&rdquo; said producer Gloria  Domina. &ldquo;It really sends a message and the message is not just for kids.&rdquo; <br />
  </p>
