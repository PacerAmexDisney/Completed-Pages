<p>February 8, 2012<br /><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong><br />
  Contact: Julie Holmquist  952-838-9000, <a href="mailto:julie.holmquist@PACER.org">julie.holmquist@PACER.org</a></p>
<h2>Join the Bullying Prevention Movement with Students Demanding Change!<br />
<em>Rally at the State Capitol on Saturday, Feb. 11 from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m.</em>
</h2>


<p><strong>MINNEAPOLIS:</strong>&nbsp; Minnesota&rsquo;s 37-word  bullying prevention law is considered one of the weakest in America and <strong>Students Demanding Change</strong> is working  hard to change that. The Twin Cities-based, student-led organization will hold  a rally at the Minnesota State Capitol on Saturday, Feb. 11, 2012, from 12 p.m.  to 1 p.m. </p>
<p>  This is  a student movement, but parents, teachers, and concerned citizens are invited  to join the students as they stand together and demand change. Participants in  the rally are encouraged to wear orange, the color of the bullying prevention  movement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is  about students protecting each other,&rdquo; said Sydney Eberwein, one of four Mounds  Park Academy students leading Students Demanding Change, with the support of <strong>PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center</strong>.  &ldquo;The students&rsquo; voice isn&rsquo;t really heard on the issue of bullying prevention.  It&rsquo;s usually just legislators talking about it. We wanted to have our voice out  there because it is a student issue.&rdquo;<br />
  </p>
<p>More  than 160,000 children miss school every day out of fear of attack or  intimidation by other students. Children who are bullied are more likely to  develop depression and anxiety disorders that do not disappear at the end of  the school year. Doctors say the effects of bullying can last a lifetime. In  some cases, bullying can even lead to suicide. <br />
  </p>
<p>Students  Demanding Change organized the rally to promote stronger bullying prevention  legislation in Minnesota. The organization believes that a student perspective  is vital if the State Legislature is going to successfully write a new law to  prevent bullying, both in schools and in social media. Students Demanding  Change is taking action and standing up against bullying for the sake of  Minnesota&rsquo;s students.<br />
</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  not just about statistics. It&rsquo;s about us as students,&rdquo; said Audrey  Berdahl-Baldwin of Students Demanding Change. &ldquo;We feel very strongly that every  student has the right to go to school and feel safe, the right to be safe.&rdquo;<br />
  </p>
