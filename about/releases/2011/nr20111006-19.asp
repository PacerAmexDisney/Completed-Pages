<h2>Join PACER's National Bullying Prevention Center on Unity Dance Day, Oct. 26, and Show Support for Children who are Bullied</h2>


<p align="center"><em>October is National Bullying Prevention Month</em></p>
<p><strong>MINNEAPOLIS:</strong>&nbsp;  Dance&mdash;and make a statement against bullying&mdash;by joining PACER&rsquo;s Unity Dance Day on  Wednesday, Oct. 26. That&rsquo;s the day when schools, students, community  organizations, and businesses around the world can unite with <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying">PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention  Center</a> in music and dance to bring awareness to  bullying prevention.<br />
</p>
<p>PACER&rsquo;s Unity Dance Day can be held anywhere &ndash; at  schools, malls, or in homes. The performances can be followed by activities  designed to inspire people to take action in their communities to prevent  bullying. <br />
  </p>
<p>&ldquo;The culture of bullying won&rsquo;t end until people across the country take  action and show children and teens that they care,&rdquo; said Julie Hertzog,  director of PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center. &ldquo;The Unity Dance Day  celebrates the influence of music and dance as a powerful avenue to reach kids  and teens about the bullying prevention message.&rdquo; <br />
  </p>
<p>Schools and community organizations can find everything they need to hold a  Unity Dance Day in PACER&rsquo;s online toolkit, available at <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/nbpm/unity-dance-mob.asp">PACER.org/bullying</a>.  The toolkit includes the designated song for the dance, the choreographed dance  moves, and additional materials and resources.<br />
  </p>
<p>The song for the event, &ldquo;You Can&rsquo;t Take That Away From Me,&rdquo; was written by  Nashville songwriters Tim Akers and Libby Weaver. Akers, the father of a child with a disability, has seen firsthand the  struggles and frustrations that some children deal with because they are viewed  as &ldquo;different.&rdquo; Performed by 11-year-old Tristan McIntosh, also of Nashville,  the song speaks about the importance of teaching children to recognize that  personality and character are more important than popularity and outward  appearances. &nbsp;<br />
  </p>
<p>The Unity Dance Day is part of PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Month of  October. Throughout the month, organizations and individuals can show their  support for the cause by visiting PACER.org/bullying and disseminating bullying  prevention <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/resources/">resources</a>,  signing the online &ldquo;The End of Bullying Begins with Me&rdquo; <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/digitalpetition/">petition</a>, and  participating in <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/nbpm/unity-day.asp">Unity  Day</a> on Oct. 12 by wearing orange and hosting different activities.<br />
  </p>
<p>PACER&rsquo;s  National Bullying Prevention Center provides creative and interactive resources  that are designed to benefit all students, including students with  disabilities. It offers educators, students, families, and individuals the  tools they need to address bullying in schools, recreational programs, or community  organizations.
