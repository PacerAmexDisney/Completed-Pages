<h2>Local bullying prevention advocates invited to White House Conference</h2>


<p><strong>Minneapolis, MN:</strong> Paula F. Goldberg, executive  director of PACER Center, and PACER advocate Lynn Miland, along with her  daughters Kelly and Maggie, have been invited to attend the White House  Conference on Bullying Prevention on Thursday, March 10.</p>
<p>President Barack  Obama, the Department of Education, and the Department of Health and Human  Services are welcoming students, parents, teachers and others to the conference  who have been affected by bullying as well as those who are taking action to  address it.&nbsp;Participants will have the opportunity to talk with Obama and  representatives from the highest levels of his administration about how all  communities can work together to prevent bullying.<strong></strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an honor to be invited to this conference,&rdquo; Goldberg said. &ldquo;For  the past five years, PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center has been  working to educate communities about this serious issue and provide communities  with the tools to prevent bullying. I&rsquo;m glad to see that the president has made  this a priority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miland&rsquo;s daughter Kelly, 19, has autism and was verbally and physically  bullied during her school years. Miland worked successfully with school  administration to keep Kelly safe at school. Miland&rsquo;s other daughter, Maggie,  has seen the effects bullying had on her sister and others and is taking action  to prevent bullying and create awareness of the issue at the Northfield, Minn.  high school where she is a junior. She created a sign titled &ldquo;NHS Stands Up to  Bullying,&rdquo; which hangs in the school&rsquo;s entry way and contains hundreds of  student signatures. The signatures are surrounded by a Martin Luther King, Jr.  quote that says: &ldquo;In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies,  but the silence of our friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>PACER&rsquo;s National  Bullying Prevention Center</strong> provides information on bullying prevention for children, teens, schools and  communities as well as tools that everyone can use to take a stand against  bullying.
