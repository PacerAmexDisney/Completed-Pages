<h2>Communities Urged to Plan Events for
October's National Bullying Prevention Month
</h2>


<p><em>Join </em><a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying"><em>PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center</em></a><em> and be Champions  for Children!</em></p>
<p>MINNEAPOLIS:&nbsp;  Communities nationwide are urged to plan for October&rsquo;s National Bullying  Prevention Month, a project of <a href="http://www.pacer.org">PACER  Center</a>, and take an active role in the movement  against bullying by using  resources at <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying"><strong>PACER.org/bullying</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;The culture of bullying won&rsquo;t  end until people across the country take action and show children and teens  that they care,&rdquo; said Julie Hertzog, director PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying  Prevention Center, which sponsors the month. The PACER event, which began in 2006, drew intense interest and evolved to National  Bullying Prevention Month in 2010.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are 160,000 children  staying home from school each day in this country for fear of bullying,&rdquo;  Hertzog said. &ldquo;Who is going to help those children feel safe at school? We need  organizations and people to plan events and activities that educate communities  about this issue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>  Organizations and individuals can  take an active role during the month by visiting PACER.org/bullying and  choosing to be:<strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="/bullying/nbpm/partners.asp"><strong>Partners</strong></a> &mdash;National  organizations can collaborate with PACER to share and disseminate the resources  for National Bullying Prevention Month with the community. </p>
<p><a href="/bullying/getinvolved/partners/champions.asp"><strong>Champions</strong></a> &mdash;Nonprofits,  schools, and community groups can use resources at  PACER.org/bullying to plan activities. Organizations and a link to their  website will be listed on PACER&rsquo;s website, along with a list of any activities  or events they are planning in connection with the month. </p>
<p><a href="/bullying/digitalpetition/"><strong>Digital Petition Signers</strong></a>&mdash;Anyone can sign &ldquo;The End of Bullying Begins with Me&rdquo;  petition to strengthen the  cause and influence legislation to protect students. </p>
<p><a href="/bullying/nbpm/runwalkroll/"><strong>Run, Walk, Roll Against  Bullying</strong> <strong>Event Organizers</strong></a>&mdash;Groups can kick off the month on Oct. 1, raise awareness, and offer prevention resources as they host a four-mile run and 1.5-mile fun walk/roll.  They can plan a Run, Walk, Roll Against Bullying by using PACER&rsquo;s free  toolkit available at <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/">PACER.org/bullying</a>. </p>
