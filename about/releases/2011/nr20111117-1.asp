<h2 align="center">FBI  presents PACER&rsquo;s National   Bullying Prevention   Center with community  leadership award</h2>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>


<p><strong>MINNEAPOLIS</strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp; FBI Special Agent in Charge Donald E. Oswald presented the 2011 FBI Director&rsquo;s Community Leadership Award to <a href="http://www.pacer.org">PACER Center</a> and its <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying" title="blocked::http://www.pacer.org/bullying">&nbsp;National Bullying Prevention Center</a> &nbsp;on Nov. 16,  thanking PACER for &ldquo;addressing America&rsquo;s  most alarming and violent trends against children.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Oswald, of the  Minneapolis FBI office, presented the prestigious award to Paula F. Goldberg, PACER&rsquo;s executive director, and Julie Hertzog, director of PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying  Prevention Center,  at PACER Center  in Minneapolis, Minn.<strong> </strong>The official award  trophy will be presented by FBI Director Robert Mueller, III in Washington, D.C.  on March 16, 2012.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each year, the FBI  is proud to recognize a champion from our community which has had a tremendous  impact on the community through the reduction of crime or improving the quality  of life,&rdquo; Oswald said.</p>
<p>Since 1990,  the Director&rsquo;s Community Leadership Award has been the FBI&rsquo;s way of recognizing  individuals and organizations which have made extraordinary contributions to  crime prevention, violence prevention or education in the community. </p>
<p>&ldquo;PACER   Center without a doubt  fits all three categories,&rdquo; Oswald said. </p>
<p>He noted PACER&rsquo;s work since 1978 on behalf of parents and  children to address the stigma of disabilities, as well as its programs for  families of children with disabilities. PACER&rsquo;s programs have gained local,  national, and international attention, with an estimated 1.3 million visitors  reaching out to PACER&rsquo;s bullying prevention website this year. More than 3  million visitors have used PACER&rsquo;s website this year in search of information,  training, and solutions to parenting and children&rsquo;s issues, including people  from more than 80 countries.</p>
<p>Oswald also praised PACER&rsquo;s bullying prevention efforts  through its National   Bullying Prevention   Center  (PACER.org/bullying), as well its websites for children:  KidsAgainstBullying.org and TeensAgainstBullying.org.</p>
<p>PACER&rsquo;s work has provided a way for kids and teens to learn  how to handle, report, and eliminate bullying, he said. One example of the teen  website&rsquo;s impact came through an e-mail to PACER from a young person who was  planning to commit suicide, but did not after finding the website.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pacer   Center continues to  organize events to bring awareness to a crime that seldom gets the attention it  deserves,&rdquo; Oswald said. &ldquo;Bullying, whether it is committed in person or  conducted on the Internet &ndash; is unacceptable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oswald honored Goldberg for her &ldquo;persistence, guidance, and  vision&rdquo; in addressing bullying, and recognized Hertzog for the day-to-day  management of the bullying prevention program.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know your program is making a difference, and we commend  you for it,&rdquo; Oswald said.</p>
<p>Each of the FBI&rsquo;s  field offices annually recommends to the FBI  Director one person or organization deemed worthy of this prestigious award. &nbsp;The Minneapolis FBI Division  represents Minnesota, North   Dakota, and South Dakota.<br />
