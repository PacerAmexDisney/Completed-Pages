<p align="center"><em>Wear  Orange and Dance During PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Month</em></p>
<p>MINNEAPOLIS: <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying">PACER&rsquo;s  National Bullying Prevention Center</a> invites everyone to wear  orange on Oct. 12 and dance on Oct. 26 during National Bullying Prevention  Month in October as a show of support for children who are bullied. PACER  originated National Bullying Prevention Month in 2006. </p>
<p>People can learn more  about Unity Day on Oct. 12, and Unity Dance Day on Oct. 26, and find many  other ways to share the bullying prevention message by visiting  PACER.org/bullying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The culture of  bullying won&rsquo;t end until people across the country take action and show  children and teens that they care,&rdquo; says Julie Hertzog, director of PACER&rsquo;s  National Bullying Prevention Center, which sponsors the month. &ldquo;Unity Day and  Unity Dance Day are perfect times to do this!&rdquo; </p>
<p><strong>Unity Day: &ldquo;Make It  Orange and Make It End&rdquo; &ndash; October 12 </strong><br />
  On<strong> </strong>Unity Day, Wednesday, Oct. 12, everyone  can wear orange and link together&mdash;in schools, communities and online&mdash;to send a  message of support to students who have experienced bullying. Students can  unite against bullying on Unity Day by wearing the color orange, using the  resources on PACER.org/bullying, handing out orange &ldquo;UNITY&rdquo; ribbons at school,  or writing the word &ldquo;UNITY&rdquo; on their hands or binders. <strong>Facebook is partnering</strong> with PACER by posting information about  Unity Day and other PACER activities on its safety, educator, and privacy pages  during October. </p>
<p><strong>Unity Dance Day  (Flash Mob Dance) &ndash; October 26 </strong> <br />
  On  Wednesday, Oct. 26, people everywhere can come together in song and dance to raise awareness for bullying  prevention by organizing a Unity Dance Day. Schools and community organizations  can find everything they need to plan a Unity Dance  Day in PACER&rsquo;s online toolkit. The toolkit includes the designated song for the  dance, the choreographed dance moves, and additional materials and resources. <strong>Facebook is a partner of PACER for Unity  Day.</strong><br />
  The  toolkit is available at <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/nbpm/unity-dance-day.asp">http://www.pacer.org/bullying/nbpm/unity-dance-day.asp</a>. <br />
