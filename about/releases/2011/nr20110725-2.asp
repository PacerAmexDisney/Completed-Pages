<h2>Join PACER in a Run, Walk, Roll Against Bullying to kick off National Bullying Prevention Month on Oct. 1 in Bloomington</h2>


<p><strong>Minneapolis, MN:&nbsp; </strong>Every day, more than 160,000 children  nationwide stay home from school to avoid being bullied. Not only are the  effects of bullying on a child felt immediately, but they can also be lifelong  &ndash; or even tragic. </p>
<p>  That&rsquo;s why <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying">PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention  Center</a> is inviting the Minnesota community to support the cause at the  second annual Run, Walk, Roll Against Bullying on Saturday, Oct. 1, in  Bloomington, Minn. as part of PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Month of  October. </p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a very real and painful  issue that kids are facing,&rdquo; said Julie Hertzog, director of PACER&rsquo;s National  Bullying Prevention Center based in Minneapolis, Minn.&nbsp; &ldquo;But they don&rsquo;t have to face it alone, and  bullying can be prevented if we all work together to change the culture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>  Registration and race packet  pick-up begin at 9 a.m., followed by a four-mile run or 1.5-mile fun walk/roll  at 10 a.m. at Mt. Normandale Lake, Normandale Blvd. and 84th St., Bloomington,  Minn. The entry fee is $20 per person, and each participant will receive a  complimentary T-shirt. Snacks and additional fun will also be provided at the  Normandale Lake Bandshell. Preregistration is strongly encouraged.</p>
<p>  For more information and to register for  the event, visit <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/">PACER.org/bullying</a> or call 952-838-9000. <em>All proceeds from PACER&rsquo;s Run, Walk, Roll Against Bullying will go to  PACER's National Bullying Prevention Center. </em></p>
<p>  WCCO-TV has joined forces with PACER as a  media partner for this event.</p>
<p>  PACER&rsquo;s  National Bullying Prevention Center provides creative and interactive resources  that are designed to benefit all students, including students with  disabilities. It offers educators,  students, families and individuals the tools they need to address bullying in  schools, recreational programs or community organizations. For more  information, visit <a href="/bullying/">PACER.org/bullying</a> or call 952-838-9000 and become a  Champion for Children! </p>
