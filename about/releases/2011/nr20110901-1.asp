<h2>October is PACER's National Bullying Prevention Month</h2>


<h3><em>Join the movement with </em><a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying" title="http://www.pacer.org/bullying"><em>PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center</em></a></h3>
<p>MINNEAPOLIS: <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying" title="http://www.pacer.org/bullying">PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center</a> has many exciting ways  for individuals and communities nationwide to join the movement during National  Bullying Prevention Month in October, which PACER originated in 2006. </p>
<p>While the major events are the Run, Walk, Roll Against Bullying on Oct. 1; Unity Day  on Oct. 12; and Unity Dance Day on Oct. 26, people can also find many other  ways to share the bullying prevention message by visiting PACER.org/bullying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The culture of bullying won&rsquo;t end until people across  the country take action and show children and teens that they care,&rdquo; says Julie  Hertzog, director of PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center, which  sponsors the month. &ldquo;This is a very real and painful issue that kids are  facing,&rdquo; Hertzog says. &ldquo;But they don&rsquo;t have to face it alone, and bullying can  be prevented if we all work together to change the culture.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Run, Walk, Roll Against Bullying</strong><br />
  PACER will host the second annual Run, Walk, Roll  Against Bullying on Oct. 1 in Minneapolis. Outside Minnesota, individuals,  schools, businesses, and organizations can host a Run, Walk, Roll Against  Bullying event in their communities using PACER&rsquo;s free toolkit, available at <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying" title="http://www.pacer.org/bullying">PACER.org/bullying.</a> The toolkit shows how to  plan a Run, Walk, Roll and includes tips, ideas, and resources. </p>
<p><strong>Unity Day: &ldquo;Make It Orange and Make It End&rdquo;&nbsp; </strong><br />
  &ldquo;Make it Orange and Make it End&rdquo; and unite against  bullying on Unity Day, Wednesday, Oct. 12. That&rsquo;s the day everyone can  wear orange and link together&mdash;in schools, communities and online&mdash;to send a  message of support to students who have experienced bullying. Students can  unite against bullying on Unity Day by wearing the color orange, using the  resources on PACER.org/bullying, handing out orange &ldquo;UNITY&rdquo; ribbons at school,  or writing the word &ldquo;UNITY&rdquo; on their hands or binders. Facebook is partnering  with PACER by posting information about Unity Day and other PACER activities on  its safety, educator, and privacy pages during October.</p>
<p><strong>Unity Dance Day </strong> <br />
  On Wednesday, Oct. 26, people everywhere can come  together in song and dance to  raise awareness for bullying prevention by organizing a Unity Dance Day.  Schools and community organizations can find everything they need to plan a Unity Dance Day in PACER&rsquo;s online toolkit. The toolkit  includes the designated song for the dance, the choreographed dance moves, and  additional materials and resources. It will be available in September at  PACER.org/bullying. </p>
<p>  Organizations and individuals can also  take an active role during National Bullying Prevention Month by visiting PACER.org/bullying and  choosing to be Partners or Champions during National Bullying Prevention  Month or signing the digital petition pledging, &ldquo;The End of Bullying Begins  with Me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>  National  partners of the month include  the National Education Association and the American Federation for Teachers.</p>
<p>  PACER&rsquo;s  National Bullying Prevention Center provides creative and interactive resources  that are designed to benefit all students, including students with  disabilities. It offers educators,  students, families and individuals the tools they need to address bullying in  schools, recreational programs or community organizations.
