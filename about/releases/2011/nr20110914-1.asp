<h2>OCTOBER IS NATIONAL BULLYING PREVENTION MONTH:
SPOOKLEY THE SQUARE PUMPKIN NAMED THE OFFICIAL SPOKES-PUMPKIN
</h2>


<p align="center"><strong><em>Spookley&rsquo;s  message of celebrating peoples&rsquo; differences to help raise awareness </em></strong></p>
<p>September 6, 2011  &ndash; It was announced today that <strong>Spookley  the Square Pumpkin</strong> has been named the Official Spokes-Pumpkin of National  Bullying Prevention Month 2011 through a partnership with PACER Center. PACER, a national organization based in Minneapolis,  Minn., works to expand opportunities and enhance the quality of life of all  children and young adults, including those with any disability, &nbsp;and their  families based on the concept of <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/about/"><strong>parents helping  parents</strong></a>.&nbsp; &ldquo;The  culture of bullying won&rsquo;t end until people across the country take action and  show children and teens that they care,&rdquo; says Julie Hertzog, director of  PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center, which sponsors the month.&nbsp; &ldquo;We love the way Spookley touches the heart  and the mind with his message of tolerance and acceptance.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Spookley the Square Pumpkin, </em>written  and createdby Joe Troiano, tells the  story of a square pumpkin living in a round pumpkin patch on Holiday Hill Farm.  Although Spookley initially faces  ridicule from his fellow patch-mates, he goes on to save the day during a  terrible storm. As a result, all the pumpkins in the patch learn that it is the  thing that makes you different that makes you special. </p>
<p>&ldquo;This book  resonates with children, parents, teachers and librarians,&rdquo; said Troiano.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thrilled to partner with PACER on this  very important issue and lend Spookley&rsquo;s positive message to this national  platform.&rdquo;<br />
  Spookley and  PACER are teaming up on a number of events, messages and applications that will  be announced later this month. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying">PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention</a> Center provides creative and interactive resources that are designed to  benefit all students, including students with disabilities. Parents and  educators can visit PACER.org/Bullying and elementary school students  PACERKidsAgainstBullying.org for additional ideas on how they can take action  against bullying. <br />
  &ldquo;This is a very  real and painful issue that kids are facing,&rdquo; Hertzog says. &ldquo;But they don&rsquo;t  have to face it alone, and bullying can be prevented if we all work together to  change the culture.&nbsp; Spookley will help us carry this message to children  and adults during <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/nbpm/">National Bullying Prevention Month</a>.&rdquo; </p>
<p>  Over 1 million <em>Spookley the Square Pumpkin</em> books have been  sold to date and it is a top selling Halloween title annually. The book will be  featured at Barnes &amp; Noble stores, online, and through Scholastic Book  Clubs this Fall.&nbsp; In addition to the book, Spookley&rsquo;s story is available  as an app for iTunes/iPad/iPhone and the Nook and <em>The Spookley Movie</em> can  be seen on the Disney Channel. Spookley will be spreading his message of  tolerance and acceptance throughout the United States and Canada starting in  late September.&nbsp;</p>
