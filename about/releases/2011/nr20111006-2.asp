<h2>Bullying Prevention Advocates Call for Social Movement 
to Address Effects of Bullying
</h2>


<p align="center"><em>October is National Bullying Prevention Month</em></p>
<p><strong>Minneapolis:&nbsp; </strong>More than 160,000 kids miss school every day out of fear of  attack or intimidation by other students.&nbsp;  Kids who are bullied are more likely to develop depression and anxiety  disorders that don&rsquo;t just go away at the end of the school year. &nbsp;Doctors say the effects of bullying can last a  lifetime.&nbsp; In some cases, bullying can  even lead to suicide.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&ldquo;When kids are bullied, they really remember it,&rdquo; said Dr.  Barry Garfinkel, child and adolescent psychiatrist at the Center for  Developmental Psychopharmacology in Minneapolis.&nbsp; &ldquo;It results in this excessive caution and  fear they can carry with them for the rest of their lives.&nbsp; Rather than being excited about life, they  are burdened with this anxiety that there are people who will hurt them emotionally  and even physically.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As part of National Bullying Prevention Month in October, <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/">PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention  Center</a> is encouraging people across the country to take action if they  witness an act of bullying.&nbsp; This is  especially important for students.&nbsp; More  than 55 percent of bullying situations stop when a peer intervenes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence is not an acceptable response to bullying,&rdquo; said Julie Hertzog, director of PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying  Prevention Center, which sponsors National Bullying Prevention Month.&nbsp; &ldquo;Adults, students and educators can no longer look away when they  see bullying.&nbsp; People who are bullied need to know they are not  alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bullying doesn&rsquo;t just happen on the playground.&nbsp; The prevalence of online communication has  dramatically changed the landscape of bullying, as it is now visible to  hundreds of friends and followers on social media websites.&nbsp; More than one in three young people have been  victims of cyberbullying. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Cyberbullying can be exceptionally traumatic because it can  be done anonymously and way too many people can witness it,&rdquo; said Dr. Read  Sulik, senior vice president of behavioral health services at Sanford Health in  Fargo, N.D.&nbsp; &ldquo;Once online, it can have a lasting and devastating impact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With so many students affected by bullying, PACER&rsquo;s National  Bullying Prevention Center wants to help parents understand what they can do if  their children are being bullied at school. Parents are encouraged to work with  their children, believe what they are saying, be supportive yet patient,  educate their children about bullying, and discuss ways to deal with the  bullying. Free resources at <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying">PACER.org/bullying</a> can help parents do this, including <a href="http://www.pacerteensagainstbullying.org/">TeensAgainstBullying.org</a> and <a href="http://www.pacerkidsagainstbullying.org/">KidsAgainstBullying.org</a>,  websites created specifically for elementary-aged children and teens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accept your children for who they are and get involved in  their lives,&rdquo; suggests Tammy Aaberg, whose son Justin committed suicide after being  bullied.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you notice signs that  they&rsquo;re acting differently, ask them how things are going at school.&nbsp; They will probably not want to open up at  first, but if you have a feeling in your gut that something is wrong, show them  you care by asking questions.&rdquo; </p>
