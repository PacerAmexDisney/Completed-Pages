<h1 align="center">&ldquo;STOP BULLYING BEFORE IT STARTS&rdquo; WITH SPOOKLEY THE SQUARE PUMPKIN AND PACER&rsquo;S NATIONAL BULLYING PREVENTION CENTER<br />
<span style="font-style:italic; font-size:.7em; font-weight:normal;">PACER and Holiday Hill Enterprises re-launch Spookley-themed educator toolkit and kickoff T-shirt fundraising campaign in preparation for National Bullying Prevention Month</span>
</h1>
<p>AUG 29, 2013 &ndash; Minneapolis, MN</p>
  <p>PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center and Holiday Hill Enterprises, the creators of Spookley the Square Pumpkin, are preparing for National Bullying Prevention Month in October with two announcements today: the re-launch of their Spookley-themed &ldquo;STOP BULLYING BEFORE IT STARTS&rdquo; free educator toolkit and the kickoff of a Spookley &ldquo;DARE TO BE SQUARE&rdquo; t-shirt fundraising campaign.&nbsp; Both initiatives are produced through a collaborative partnership between the PACER Center and Holiday Hill Enterprises, with Spookley retuning for the third consecutive year as PACER&rsquo;s official &ldquo;Spokes Pumpkin&rdquo; for National Bullying Prevention Month in October.</p>
  <p>Spookley is a square pumpkin in a round pumpkin patch world, and his story was first introduced to millions of children through Joe Troiano&rsquo;s book, <em>The Legend of Spookley the Square Pumpkin</em>.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Stop Bullying Before it Starts&rdquo; Free Digital Teacher Toolkit provides educators with Spookley-themed resources to promote kindness, tolerance, and bullying prevention in their classrooms.&nbsp; Specific resources include discussion guides and learning activities that complement a reading of <em>The Legend of Spookley the Square Pumpkin</em>, as well as a Spookley classroom play written especially for the program by Troiano.&nbsp; The toolkit also provides educators with free online access to an audio-visual recording of the book performed by Bobby &ldquo;Boris&rdquo; Pickett, writer and performer of the hit song, &ldquo;The Monster Mash,&rdquo; and to a streaming version of the &ldquo;Spookley the Square Pumpkin&rdquo; movie.&nbsp; PACER is hosting the toolkit online and educators can register for free access at <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/resources/activities/toolkits/spookley/">http://www.pacer.org/bullying/resources/activities/toolkits/spookley/</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&quot;<em>The Legend of Spookley the Square Pumpkin</em> deals with advanced concepts of tolerance, diversity and acceptance in ways that are easily understood by early learners,&quot; said Julie Hertzog, director of PACER's National Bullying Prevention Center.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;There is a pressing need for bullying prevention teaching tools targeted specifically to early learners,&quot; Hertzog continued, &ldquo;and we are delighted to offer the expanded Spookley resources this year to help stop bullying before it starts.&rdquo;&nbsp; New additions to the toolkit include directions for staging the Spookley classroom play in a way that reinforces the play&rsquo;s bullying-prevention messaging and instructions for creating a &ldquo;Spookley storybook trail&rdquo; through the school that engages multiple classrooms and age groups in the learning experience.</p>
  <p>In addition to re-launching the toolkit today, PACER and Holiday Hill Enterprises are kicking off their &ldquo;DARE TO BE SQUARE&rdquo; t-shirt campaign (<a href="http://www.booster.com/daretobesquare">http://www.booster.com/daretobesquare</a>).&nbsp; The campaign will run from today through October 11th and purchased shirts will be delivered approximately two weeks after the campaign closes.&nbsp; 100% of profits from t-shirt sales will be donated to PACER.</p>

  <p><strong>About Spookley the Square Pumpkin and Holiday Hill Farm</strong>:&nbsp; Created and written by Joe Troiano, <em>The Legend of Spookley the Square Pumpkin</em> is an illustrated storybook that has become a perennial best-seller and fall season favorite among children, teachers and parents.&nbsp; The Spookley story is now also available as an app for the iPad/iPhone, Android and Nook platforms.&nbsp; The animated classic, &quot;Spookley the Square Pumpkin,&quot; will air once again this October on television in the US and abroad.&nbsp; Spookley is a featured attraction at a growing network of pumpkin patches and &ldquo;agritourism&rdquo; destinations across North America.&nbsp; Spookley lives on Holiday Hill Farm, a world where stories teach life lessons and which is the setting for Joe Troiano's other storybook classics <em>Mistletoe and the Christmas Kittens</em>, <em>Lyla the Lovesick Ladybug</em>, <em>JellyBean the Unbreakable Egg</em> and <em>Beacon the Bright Little Firefly</em>.</p>
