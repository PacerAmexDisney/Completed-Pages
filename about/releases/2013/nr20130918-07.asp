<h2>PACER&rsquo;s Run, Walk, Roll Against Bullying on Oct. 5 Marks Beginning of National Bullying Prevention Month</h2>
<p><strong>Minneapolis: </strong><strong>More than 13 million American children are bullied each year &ndash; that&rsquo;s one of every three students &ndash; and bullying significantly impacts the emotional and physical well-being of those involved. </strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying">PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center</a> is inviting the Minnesota community to show support for students who are bullied at the fourth annual Run, Walk, Roll Against Bullying on Saturday, Oct. 5, in Bloomington, Minn. &ldquo;So many students are in need of support from adults, other students, and community members to address this issue,&rdquo; said Julie Hertzog, director of PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center, based in Minneapolis. &ldquo;Community-wide efforts like this show students that there are people who really want to help.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The outdoor event kicks off PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Month of October and offers an opportunity for adults and students to help raise funds to support bullying prevention. All proceeds from PACER&rsquo;s Run, Walk, Roll Against Bullying support the work of PACER's National Bullying Prevention Center.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is a fun way for people to gather their friends and family and do something positive for students who are bullied,&rdquo; said Paula F. Goldberg, PACER Center&rsquo;s executive director. &ldquo;PACER creates practical, innovative resources and tools for students, parents, and educators to help prevent bullying, and this is one of the activities which makes that possible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Presented by American Dairy Queen and the Friends of PACER, the 4-mile run or 1.5-mile walk or roll is held at Normandale Lake Park, Normandale Blvd. and 84th St., Bloomington, Minn. Registration is at 9 a.m.; the race begins at 10 a.m. Participants and spectators will gather after the race at the Normandale Lake Bandshell for entertainment, speakers, snacks, and family fun.</p>
  <p>The entry fee is $20 per person for adults, $10 for ages 7 to 16, and includes a complimentary event T-shirt. Children ages 6 and under are free. Participants are encouraged to gather pledges from family, friends, co-workers, and local businesses.
