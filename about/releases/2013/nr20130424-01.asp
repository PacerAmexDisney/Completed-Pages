<h2>FamilySignal announces partnership with PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center</h2>


<p>Birmingham, Mich. &ndash; FamilySignal &ndash; the online service that helps parents monitor their children&rsquo;s social media accounts &ndash; announces a partnership with PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center, which unites, engages and educates communities nationwide to address bullying through creative, relevant, and interactive resources. PACER&rsquo;s bullying prevention resources are designed to benefit all students, including those with disabilities. </p>
<p>FamilySignal helps protect children by monitoring Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts for conversations involving bullying, sex, drugs, alcohol, violence, profanity, racism and hate. Parents are notified within minutes &ndash; with a simple text message on their cell phones &ndash; when potential danger is detected so they can take immediate action. The service costs $4.99 per month and can be canceled at any time. According to the National Crime Prevention Council, 43 percent of teenagers nationwide reported being targets of cyber-bullying in the last year. Only 11 percent talked to their parents about instances of cyber-bullying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every alert related to bullying will now include a link to PACER.org/Bullying to lead parents directly to their helpful resources for families and their children,&rdquo; said FamilySignal co-founder Brian Eisenberg, a father of four. &ldquo;PACER will in turn make people aware of the online monitoring service we provide for families. Working together, hand-in-hand, we can broaden our reach and help young people who experience bullying.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>To learn more about PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center go to PACER.org/Bullying</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>For a live demonstration of FamilySignal&rsquo;s software, and to learn more about how this new technology is protecting children, contact Brian Eisenberg at (248) 752-8181 or email brian@familysignal.com. </strong></p>
