<h1>School of Rock selects PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center as charity of choice for monies raised at its BEST OF MINNESOTA benefit concert in April 2015</h1>
<p>(St Paul MN) &hellip; School of Rock, the premier performance-based music education program in the world, has selected <strong>PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center </strong>as a recipient of funds raised at an upcoming benefit concert.</p>
<p>Next month local School of Rock students, ages 8 &ndash; 18, will perform alongside some of Minnesota&rsquo;s most notable professional musicians at <strong>BEST OF MINNESOTA</strong>, an all-ages live concert, to raise funds for PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;While School of Rock teaches music and performance, we also teach students to be responsible musicians. One of those responsibilities includes using their talent to give back to the community,&rdquo; said Stacey Marmolejo, School of Rock Twin Cities franchise owner. &ldquo;In my experience, creative types are often the target of bullying,&rdquo; added Marmolejo. &ldquo;Given musicians are among the most creative people, the partnership with PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center is a natural fit with School of Rock.&nbsp; It delights me that we can do anything to help them prevent bullying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Music is a powerful force in sharing the important message of preventing bullying&mdash;and encouraging kindness, inclusion and acceptance. We are thrilled to be a part of this amazing benefit concert,&rdquo; said Julie Hertzog, Director, PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center.</p>
<p>School of Rock Twin Cities Regional Manager, Nate Beck, will announce the list of Twin Cities iconic musicians who will perform with the studentson Monday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an incredible lineup of professional musicians and I&rsquo;d like to challenge local music fans to join forces with us to not only create a mind-blowing event but also to raise an unprecedented amount of funds for PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center and the young people they work to protect,&rdquo; said Beck. &nbsp;</p>

  All proceeds from the concert will be shared between PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center, Rock School Scholarship Fund and Adopt A Classroom.</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT SCHOOL OF ROCK</strong> <br />
  <a href="http://www.schoolofrock.com/">School of Rock</a> is the premier music education program for kids under 18 years old.&nbsp; Founded in 1998 in Philadelphia PA, there are now 150 locations in eight countries, including two in the Twin Cities. Created on the premise that taking music lessons and never playing a gig is like going to basketball practice and never playing a game, School of Rock students participate in weekly private lessons and weekly group rehearsals which lead to performing live rock concerts in real rock venues. &nbsp;</p>
