<h2>Schools, students and families can take action now and during PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Month</h2>
<p>Minneapolis: Back to school is an exciting time for many children and teens, but for the 13 million American students who are bullied each year, the beginning of the school year can also be a time of stress and anxiety. Students, educators, and families can take action now in preparation for the school year and for PACER&rsquo;S National Bullying Prevention Month in October. The month, which was launched by PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center in 2006, helps schools and communities nationwide raise awareness and take action to prevent bullying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bullying can lead to school avoidance, decreased self-esteem, depression, and even self-harm,&rdquo; said Julie Hertzog, director of PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center in Minneapolis, Minn. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important for schools to be proactive in preventing bullying, and National Bullying Prevention Month in October is well-timed to spread the message that every student deserves to feel safe at school, in the community and online, and there are people who care.&rdquo;</p>
