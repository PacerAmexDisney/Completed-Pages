<h2>Celebrate kinder, more accepting, and inclusive communities at The National Unity Awards on June 9</h2>
<p>Minneapolis: PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center is inviting students and adults to celebrate those who have made outstanding contributions to address and prevent bullying at The National Unity Awards on Tuesday, June 9 in Bloomington, Minn. </p>
<p>In April, the National Bullying Prevention Center invited students, parents, educators, and community members to submit nominations of individuals and groups who have gone above and beyond to help address bullying in their city or state. Nominations and inspiring stories came in from across the United States for four award categories, including, &ldquo;United Against Bullying,&rdquo; &ldquo;United for Kindness,&rdquo; &ldquo;United for Acceptance,&rdquo; and &ldquo;United for Inclusion.&rdquo; The four award recipients were selected by a committee and will be honored at this special event.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are overwhelmed by the number of nominations received from throughout the country for our first Unity Awards celebration,&rdquo; said Julie Hertzog, director of PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center. &ldquo;The Unity Awards has given us the opportunity to hear so many stories of courage, leadership, and inspiration that we may never have heard otherwise. It was difficult to select just a few individuals to honor at this event and we are proud of everyone who was nominated.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The event kicks off with a reception beginning at 6:30 p.m., which will include a fun photo booth, food, and more. The Main Event begins at 7:00 p.m. and will be emceed by Mike Augustyniak, chief weather anchor for WCCO television. In addition to the awards ceremony, there will be a special performance by teenage singer and songwriter Anna Richey of Utah and a premiere of the new PACER video, &ldquo;Turn a Life Around.&rdquo; The event is presented by PACER Center and The Faces of Change&mdash;The Youth Advisory Board of PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center and the space is provided by the Bloomington Human Rights Commission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Unity Awards are a wonderful way to celebrate the individuals and groups that are working to prevent bullying and make our communities safer,&rdquo; said Paula F. Goldberg, PACER Center&rsquo;s executive director. &ldquo;We know how important it is for students who are bullied to feel that they are not alone, and attending this event is a great way to show them that they are cared for and supported.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All community members are welcome to attend and <a href="mailto:julie.hertzog@pacer.org?subject=Unity%20Awards%20RSVP&amp;body=I%20am%20planning%20on%20attending%20the%20Unity%20Awards.%20%0D%0A%0D%0AHow%20many%20guests%20are%20coming%20with%20you%3F">RSVPs are encouraged,</a> but not required.
