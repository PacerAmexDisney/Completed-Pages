<h2>PACER Center&rsquo;s Inspiring Opportunities Project offers resources<strong>&nbsp;for families of children with mental health and behavioral disorders</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Minneapolis:</strong> Families of children with mental health and emotional or behavioral needs often have to navigate multiple systems of care to access supports and services for their son or daughter. Families may also face additional challenges due to stigma about mental health. PACER&rsquo;s new Children&rsquo;s Mental Health and Emotional or Behavioral Disorders Inspiring Opportunities Project (PACER.org/childrensmentalhealth) is designed to address these challenges by bringing together parents, youth, professionals, and the community to help individuals and families receive resources and support. The project also promotes increased understanding of children&rsquo;s mental health and emotional or behavioral needs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;PACER has been helping children with mental health needs for more than 20 years, and this project enables us to do much more,&rdquo; said Paula Goldberg, PACER&rsquo;s executive director. &ldquo;We called it &lsquo;Inspiring Opportunities&rsquo; because we hope that children who receive the services they need will have the opportunity to reach their full potential as adults.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to offering individual support and workshops that help families develop strategies to support their child&rsquo;s mental health and emotional needs, PACER has developed new innovative web-based resources for families, which are available at PACER.org/childrensmentalhealth. This cutting-edge website offers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Interactive tools: Families and professionals can learn more about mental health issues through quizzes, a roadmap of when and where to get help, videos, and an array of PACER publications.</li>
  <li>Blog posts: PACER is a monthly contributor to Babble.com, the highly acclaimed online magazine and blog network published by the Walt Disney Company for parents. These posts cover a variety of hot mental health topics, from tantrums and fights over homework to bullying and bipolar disorder.</li>
  <li>National directory: PACER has compiled a directory of national organizations that can help families of children with mental health and emotional or behavioral needs. </li>
  <li>Success stories: Families can find inspiration and advice through real-life success stories, and can even share their own stories.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;We know that receiving help can make a tremendous difference for children with mental health and emotional or behavioral needs,&rdquo; said Goldberg. &ldquo;PACER now has more resources available for these children and their families.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For more information on the Children&rsquo;s Mental Health and Emotional or Behavioral Project, visit PACER.org/CMH, e-mail pacer@pacer.org, or call (952) 838-9000.</p>
