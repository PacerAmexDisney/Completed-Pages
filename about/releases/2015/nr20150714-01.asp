<h2>Very special educator headlines PACER&rsquo;s National Symposium about Children &amp; Young Adults with Mental Health and Learning Disabilities</h2>


<p>As a child with Tourette syndrome, Brad Cohen was ridiculed, mocked, and shunned. Today, he is one very special educator and he&rsquo;ll share his remarkable story at the 10th Annual National PACER Symposium on Children and Young Adults with Mental Health and Learning Disabilities. Cohen is an award-winning teacher, school administrator, motivational speaker and co-author of the book, &ldquo;Front of the Class: How Tourette Syndrome Made Me the Teacher I Never Had.&rdquo; His life story has been featured on &ldquo;Oprah,&rdquo; CNN, and in a Hallmark TV movie and the &ldquo;New York Times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cohen is one of three outstanding national speakers who will headline the PACER Symposium which brings together 1,000 parents and educators for an impactful day that provides outstanding practical information about children&rsquo;s mental health and learning disabilities, as well as proactive, positive teaching strategies and interventions. The symposium is from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Tuesday, Aug. 4, at the Minneapolis Convention Center. Six continuing education clock hours are available for participating educators.</p>
<p>In addition to Cohen and a variety of outstanding breakout presenters, there will be two other keynote speakers:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><strong>Steven Koppel</strong> is the founder of MyMoments, a non-profit social enterprise that is pioneering the use of Expressive Digital Imagery (EDI). This new form of self-expression created on smartphones is being used as a helpful tool for youth with mental health challenges at such institutions as the renowned McLean Hospital in Boston. </li>
  <li><strong>Jodi Sleeper-Triplett</strong> is a trainer, master coach, mentor, speaker, and author who is considered by her peers to be the foremost expert on coaching youth with ADHD. She provides training programs for coaches, educators, and mental health professionals worldwide.</li>
</ul>
