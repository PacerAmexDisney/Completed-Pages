<h2>The Unity Awards: Nominate Someone From Your School or Neighborhood Who Has Helped Create Kinder, More Accepting, and Inclusive Communities</h2>
<p><strong>Minneapolis:</strong> Bullying is an issue that no child should ever have to endure. Fortunately, there are people who care and take action to make our communities, schools and the web kinder, more accepting places. PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center will recognize these outstanding individuals from across the nation at the<strong> Unity Awards</strong>.</p>
<p>This special event will honor individuals from across the nation on Tuesday, June 9, 2015, at the Bloomington Center for the Arts in Bloomington, Minn. Students, parents, educators, and community members are encouraged to submit nominations to recognize individuals and groups who have gone above and beyond to help address bullying in their city or state. Nominations might be for a well-known story of a person or group who made a difference on a national scale, or for someone who simply makes others feel like they&rsquo;re not alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is an event to inspire and involve, and it&rsquo;s an opportunity to recognize actions that often go unnoticed,&rdquo; said Julie Hertzog, director of PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to raise awareness that there are people who are making a difference, whether it&rsquo;s the group that creates a club to promote acceptance or the individual who invites a peer to sit with them at lunch. &nbsp;When we stand together, no one stands alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The event is presented by The Faces of Change&mdash;The Youth Advisory Board of PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center. &ldquo;Student involvement is so important to this cause,&rdquo; said Hertzog. &ldquo;The Faces of Change is a group of young advocates from across the nation who were inspired to celebrate the positive changes that are happening as a result of young people saying that bullying is not acceptable.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;As someone who experienced bullying, I know how important it was to know that someone was there for you. I now advocate for education and support of those targeted,&rdquo; said Jacob Law, member of The Faces of Change. &ldquo;This event is significant in that it raises awareness in a way that celebrates those who have made a difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Special thanks to the Bloomington Human Rights Commission for their support and for providing the wonderful venue for this important event,&rdquo; said Paula Goldberg, PACER Center&rsquo;s executive director. &ldquo;Community support for this issue shows just how much people care about students and their right to grow up in a safe environment.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>About PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center:</strong> Founded in 2006, PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center actively leads social change, so that bullying is no longer considered an accepted childhood rite of passage. PACER provides innovative resources for students, parents, educators, and others, and recognizes bullying as a serious community issue that impacts education, physical and emotional health, and the safety and well-being of students. PACER offers tools to address bullying in schools, the community, and online. For more information, visit PACER.org/bullying or call (952) 838-9000 or (888) 248-0822 (national toll free). &nbsp;</p>
