<h1 align="center"><strong>CUSTOMINK TEAMS UP WITH GINA RODRIGUEZ TO KICK OFF ITS 5TH ANNUAL &ldquo;BE GOOD TO EACH OTHER&rdquo; BULLYING PREVENTION CAMPAIGN</strong><br /></h1>
<p align="center"><em>Notable Celebrities and Athletes Partner with CustomInk to Create Custom T-shirts in Support of PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center</em>
<p>FAIRFAX, VA (September 10, 2015) &ndash; <a href="http://www.customink.com/">CustomInk</a>, the leading provider of custom apparel and accessories for groups and occasions, today launches its 5th annual <a href="http://www.customink.com/stopbullying">Be Good to Each Other campaign</a> in support of National Bullying Prevention Month and its signature event Unity Day, which takes place on October 21st. Together with <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying">PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center</a>, the Be Good to Each Other campaign aims to unite students and adults in an effort to take a stand against bullying and promote kindness, acceptance, and inclusion within their communities. CustomInk has again partnered with a roster of talented individuals from across the media and entertainment industry &ndash; TV, music, movies, and sports &ndash; to support the campaign by designing their own custom bullying prevention t-shirts. </p>
<p>&ldquo;At CustomInk, we believe that every person deserves to be treated with respect, kindness, and compassion, and we exhibit that sentiment through our own Core Values,&rdquo; said Wendy Connell, vice president of marketing at CustomInk. &ldquo;For our fifth annual Be Good to Each Other campaign, we are proud to continue our partnership with PACER as we instill that important message among students, school groups, and communities through the unifying power of the t-shirt.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Over the past five years, CustomInk has donated nearly $120,000 towards bullying prevention efforts and sold tens of thousands of shirts for the cause. The power of t-shirts goes beyond the funds raised, as people continue to wear the shirts they&rsquo;ve purchased and spread the word that bullying is unacceptable. Gina Rodriguez will help the Be Good to Each Other campaign kick off its 2015 efforts along with 11 other celebrities. Each celebrity supporter has created his or her own bullying prevention t-shirt that will be on sale for the duration of the campaign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so excited to work with CustomInk on this year&rsquo;s Be Good to Each Other campaign. No one is immune to the risks of bullying and the only way to prevent it, is to promote kindness and inclusion in our daily lives,&rdquo; say Gina Rodriguez, star of <em>Jane the Virgin</em>. &ldquo;My parents always taught me the power of thinking positively and treating others with respect, and I hope that through this campaign we are able to continue the spread of that message to the younger generations.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Other notable celebrities designing shirts for this year&rsquo;s campaign include: Addison Riecke (<em>The Thundermans</em>), Aija Mayrock (<em>The Survival Guide to Bullying</em>), Alyson Stoner (<em>Cheaper by the Dozen</em>), Deontay &ldquo;The Bronze Bomber&rdquo; Wilder (World Heavyweight Champion), Gracie Gold (Olympic Figure Skater), Melissa Rauch (<em>The Big Bang Theory</em>), Miles Heizer (<em>Parenthood</em>), Paola Andino (<em>Every Witch Way</em>), Quincy Davis (Professional Surfer), Rachel Platten (Singer) and Wesam Keesh (<em>Awkward</em>).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Founded in 2006, National Bullying Prevention Month and Unity Day were both created to help raise awareness of the devastating effects of bullying and to inspire support of bullying prevention activities among youth,&rdquo; said Julie Hertzog, director of PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center. &ldquo;We are excited at the opportunity to partner with CustomInk again to further fulfill our mission of bullying prevention awareness and are grateful for the celebrity partners who have stepped forward to support the campaign.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Now through October 31st, the Be Good to Each Other campaign will encourage student groups and others to join together and show support by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Designing their own custom bullying prevention t-shirts; </li>
  <li>Ordering PACER&rsquo;s Official 2015 Unity Day t-shirt; and</li>
  <li>Purchasing an exclusive celebrity-designed t-shirt.</li>
</ul>
<p>CustomInk will handle printing and fulfillment at cost, allowing 100% of the profits from the sales of bullying prevention t-shirts to benefit PACER in its effort to engage, educate, and unite communities nationwide. T-shirts are available for purchase at <a href="http://www.customink.com/stopbullying/2015?pc=PR-147031&amp;utm_source=stopbullying&amp;utm_medium=pr&amp;utm_campaign=stopbullying%200915&amp;cm_mmc=PR-_-Stopbullying-_-0915-_-">www.customink.com/stopbullying</a>. </p>
