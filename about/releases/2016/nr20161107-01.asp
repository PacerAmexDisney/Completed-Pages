<h2>PACER&rsquo;s Raise a Glass event is Nov. 30 at Surly Brewing Co. <br />
</h2>
<p><em>This exciting event supports PACER&rsquo;s Simon Technology Center and National Bullying Prevention Center</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Raise a Glass &ndash; A Toast to PACER&rdquo; is a fantastic evening that supports PACER&rsquo;s projects. It will take place at 6 p.m. on Wednesday, Nov. 30 at <a href="http://surlybrewing.com/">Surly Brewing Co.</a>, 520 Malcolm Ave. S.E., Minneapolis.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s event features tiered tickets, one of which includes a 30-minute tour of Surly&rsquo;s facilities so guests can see firsthand how the beer is made.</p>
<p>This annual event is organized by the Friends of PACER and PACER&rsquo;s Young Professionals Advisory Board, a group of Minnesota young professionals who want to make a difference in the lives of children with disabilities and children who are bullied. Proceeds raised will support <a href="http://www.pacer.org/stc/">PACER&rsquo;s Simon Technology Center</a>, which makes assistive technology more accessible to children and young adults with disabilities, and <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/">PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center</a>, which actively leads social change so that bullying is no longer considered an accepted childhood rite of passage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are excited to host this night of food and drinks that will further the work we do for families of children with all disabilities, as well as those who experience bullying,&rdquo; said Paula Goldberg, PACER&rsquo;s executive director. &ldquo;This is a wonderful opportunity to enjoy a night out in Minneapolis, and see the positive impact that individuals can have on the families we support.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two ticket options are available: Friend Tickets are $20, and include appetizers and one drink token; Patron Tickets are $35, and include appetizers, two drink tokens, and a tour of Surly. Additionally, a Surly beer tasting can be added to either ticket option for $5. Tickets for non-drinkers are $15.</p>
