<h2>National Bullying Prevention Month, 10th Anniversary Planned</h2>
<p><strong>Minneapolis: </strong>Much can occur in a decade, and PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center proves it. Over the past 10 years, the Center&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Month campaign grew from a small week-long event to a worldwide effort with multiple activities and products throughout October. National Bullying Prevention Month is supported by hundreds of schools, major corporations, and celebrities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the campaign&rsquo;s beginning, celebrities such as Ellen DeGeneres and Demi Lovato and organizations such as the National PTA and National Education Association have publicly supported PACER&rsquo;s bullying prevention efforts,&rdquo; said Paula F. Goldberg, executive director of PACER Center.</p>
<p>There are many ways schools and community members can get involved this October for the 10-year anniversary of National Bullying Prevention Month:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/nbpm/"><strong>Wear orange:</strong></a> People can send a message of unity and support by wearing orange items, such as a T-shirt, socks, hat, tie, wristband, or shoelaces. </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/nbpm/unity-day.asp"><strong>Celebrate Unity Day:</strong></a> Students, teachers, and community members will wear orange and send a united message of support on Unity Day, Wednesday, Oct. 19. This is the day everyone can come together &ndash; in schools, communities, and online &ndash; to send one large orange message of support, hope, and unity. </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/nbpm/communityevents.asp"><strong>Hold events and activities</strong></a>: Communities around the country mark National Bullying Prevention Month through creative events and initiatives. There are many resources, including classroom toolkits, free bookmarks, posters, and awareness-raising ideas available at PACER.org/Bullying.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;October is a time when educators, students, parents, and community members can unite to share their support for the important issue of bullying prevention,&rdquo; said Julie Hertzog, director of PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center. &ldquo;Together, we can make our schools and communities safer.&rdquo;</p>
