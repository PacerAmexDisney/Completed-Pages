<h1 align="center">CUSTOMINK KICKS OFF ITS 6TH ANNUAL &ldquo;BE GOOD TO EACH OTHER&rdquo; BULLYING PREVENTION CAMPAIGN WITH CHARLIE PUTH</h1>
<p align="center"><em>Notable Personalities Partner with CustomInk to Create Custom T-shirts in Support of PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center</em></p>
<p>FAIRFAX, VA (August 30, 2016) &ndash; <a href="http://www.customink.com/">CustomInk</a>, the leading provider of custom apparel and accessories for groups and communities, kicks off its 6th annual <a href="http://www.customink.com/stopbullying">Be Good to Each Other campaign</a> today, calling attention to bullying prevention and honoring National Bullying Prevention Month throughout the month of October. In support of <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying">PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center</a>, the Be Good to Each Other campaign unites people of all ages by encouraging them to take a stand against bullying and promote kindness, acceptance, and inclusion. CustomInk has again partnered with a roster of prominent celebrities to support the campaign, who have each designed their own limited edition custom t-shirt. </p>
<p>&ldquo;At CustomInk, we're all about bringing people together in positive ways and strengthening their sense of community through custom apparel,&rdquo; said Lisa Macpherson, Chief Marketing Officer at CustomInk. &ldquo;The Be Good to Each Other campaign not only promotes community inclusion, respect, and compassion, it is also an expression of the power of t-shirts to support the effort to collectively end bullying.&rdquo;<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  For the past five years, CustomInk has raised awareness of bullying prevention efforts through the sales of custom anti-bullying gear. This year, participating influencers were given the word &ndash; &ldquo;Be&rdquo; &ndash; and encouraged to create a positive and motivational message that reinforces self-worth while promoting acceptance in a personal, yet unifying way. Phrases featured in the campaign include &ldquo;Be Daringly Different,&rdquo; &ldquo;Be Unbreakable,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Be Dynamic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlie Puth, 2016 Billboard Music Awards winner and platinum Recording Artist, helped to ignite the campaign by creating a t-shirt showcasing the phrase &ldquo;Be Unique.&rdquo; Through the statement on his shirt, Puth is vocalizing his disapproval of bullying, asking people to take pride in what makes them unique, and encouraging his fans to rally behind this important cause. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s important for all of us to speak up and encourage young people to be good to one another,&rdquo; said Charlie Puth. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m excited to stand alongside CustomInk and support the Be Good to Each Other campaign to help bring awareness to bullying prevention month and encourage people nationwide to put an end to bullying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other voices joining the cause have created their own bullying prevention t-shirts that will be on sale for the duration of the campaign. These individuals include: Elias Harger (Actor), Jackson Harris (Recording Artist), Jenna Ortega (Actress), Jordan Smith (Singer), Kennedy Raye (Influencer), Lilimar Hernandez (Actress), Lizzy Greene (Actress), Madeline Stuart (Fashion Model), Madison De La Garza (Actress), Michael Campion (Actor), and Milla &ldquo;Star&rdquo; Bizzotto (Athlete).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since it was founded ten years ago in October of 2006, National Bullying Prevention Month has helped raise awareness of the effects of bullying and sparked conversations, community action and social media support,&rdquo; said Julie Hertzog, director of PACER. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important that we keep the momentum moving forward with campaigns, like CustomInk&rsquo;s Be Good to Each Other, to help build safe and supportive schools, communities and online environments for students.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Through October 31st, CustomInk will donate profits from the sales of bullying prevention t-shirts, up to $100,000, to PACER in its effort to engage, educate, and unite communities nationwide.
