<h2><strong>SQUARE ENIX PARTNERS WITH</strong> <strong>PACER&rsquo;S NATIONAL BULLYING PREVENTION CENTER </strong></h2>


<p><strong>LOS ANGELES </strong>(<strong>January 13, 2016) </strong>&nbsp;- To celebrate everyday heroes standing up against bullying, <em>LIFE IS STRANGE&trade;</em> publisher, Square Enix&reg;, has partnered with PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center (NBPC) for a special community donation challenge. </p>
<p>The team behind <em>LIFE IS STRANGE</em> and PACER encourage their communities to use the hashtag #EverydayHeroes &nbsp;to share their stories about overcoming adversity, standing up for what&rsquo;s right, helping a friend in need, and more. For every post using the hashtag #EverydayHeroes from January 13 to January 19th, Square Enix will make a donation to PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center. To highlight the heroes all around us, these stories will also be featured online at <a href="http://everydayheroes.lifeisstrange.com/">everydayheroes.lifeisstrange.com</a>. </p>
<p>To introduce this partnership, Square Enix has created a video, voiced by Ashly Burch (award-winning voice actress behind Chloe in <em>LIFE IS STRANGE</em>). That video can be viewed on YouTube [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ao2PTDCiRxU"><strong>here</strong></a>]. </p>
