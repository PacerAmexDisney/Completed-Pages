<h2><strong>UCLA student named ambassador of PACER&rsquo;s&nbsp;National Bullying Prevention Center</strong></h2>
<p><em>Erin Barlow is available to speak to schools and communities about bullying, </em><br />
  <em>an issue that was cited in this summer&rsquo;s California Healthy Kids Survey</em></p>
<p><strong>Minneapolis</strong>: PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center has announced that Erin Barlow will serve as the organization&rsquo;s National Ambassador and Advisory Board member.&nbsp;Barlow, who speaks eloquently about her own encounter with bullying, is a Theater major at UCLA and is available to speak to middle and high school students throughout the United States, and especially in California. </p>
<p>PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center has an office in Los Angeles.The innovative resources that the Center provides are critical, considering the results of the most recent California Healthy Kids Survey that was released in July. According to the survey of California students, 40 percent of seventh graders, 38 percent of ninth graders, and 31 percent of 11th graders reported being harassed or bullied at school.</p>
<p>Across the country, one in four students reports being bullied during the school year, according to the National Center for Educational Statistics. </p>
<p>It is Barlow&rsquo;s mission to let all know that they are not alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you have been bullied, please know that everyone deserves to be safe, respected and valued,&rdquo; Barlow says. &ldquo;Never let others determine your self-worth. Striving for happiness and getting help was the best decision I made. I didn&rsquo;t give up on myself and neither should you.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Barlow created a video on the importance of bullying prevention exclusively for PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center. Her three-minute story is available online at <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/getinvolved/erin-barlow.asp">PACER.org/bullying</a>.</p>

<p>October marks the 10-year anniversary of National Bullying Prevention Month, which PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center founded in 2006. The Center actively leads social change, so that bullying is no longer considered an accepted childhood rite of passage. PACER offers tools to address bullying in schools, the community, and online.
