<h2>Miami Dolphins Host Hometown Huddle in Partnership with PACER</h2>
<p><strong>Miami Lakes, Fla. </strong>&ndash; Miami Dolphins alumni Troy Drayton, Lousaka Polite and Twan Russell and cheerleaders Etta, Kristan and Rachael, in partnership with United Way and PACER, hosted a Hometown Huddle at Bob Graham Education Center on Oct. 18. The group hosted a Gatorade Junior Training Camp as the students participated in several fitness-orientated stations and learn the benefits of hydration and staying physically active. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Today we&rsquo;re partnering with United Way and PACER for this tremendous event. Tomorrow is Unity Day, so we&rsquo;re out here showing the kids a good time and we&rsquo;re also delivering an anti-bullying message,&rdquo; Miami Dolphins alum and Youth Programs Manager Troy Drayton said. &ldquo;So today&rsquo;s a special day for us. It&rsquo;s just a part of what we do and a part of the Miami Dolphins being in the community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Additionally, a UNITY station was added in honor of UNITY day. The kids pledged against bullying and created crafts using positive words. The Dolphins are working closely with PACER's National Bullying Prevention Center to spread awareness of bullying prevention and to celebrate Unity Day to be united for kindness, acceptance and inclusion. PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center, which initiated National Bullying Prevention Month and Unity Day, encourages students, parents, teachers, community members, schools and organizations to wear and share orange to support those who experience bullying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unity Day is an opportunity to make a powerful statement that encourages everyone to unite for kindness, acceptance and inclusion,&rdquo; PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center Director Julie Hertzog said. &ldquo;Bullying affects one out of every four children each year, and many say they feel alone in their experience. On Unity Day, we show our support and pledge to create safe environments for all children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The day concluded with a Fins Frenzy, hosted by Dolphins Alum Twan Russell with mascot T.D. The Dolphins highlighted the importance of education, physical fitness and positive choices. </p>
<p>The Miami Dolphins Youth Programs&rsquo; mission is to emphasize the importance of education, physical fitness, and positive choices for kids in a safe and fun environment. The Miami Dolphins Youth Programs&rsquo; vision is to prepare the next generation of leaders in staying physically active through our Junior Training Camps (JTC), Youth Football Clinics, and Youth Football Camps. </p>
