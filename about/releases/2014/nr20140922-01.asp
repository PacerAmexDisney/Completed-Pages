<h2>Motivational Speaker and Author Nick Vujicic Partners with PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center to Help Children be Safe</h2>
<p>MINNEAPOLIS: Motivational speaker and author Nick Vujicic (VOO-yee-chich) is teaming up with PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center during National Bullying Prevention Month in October to speak out about bullying prevention at schools and on social media, where he has millions of followers. Founder of the nonprofit organization Life Without Limbs and motivational speaking company Attitude is Altitude, Vujicic was born without arms and legs, and has faced countless challenges and obstacles throughout his life, including being the target of bullies. </p>
<p>Paula Goldberg, executive director and co-founder of PACER Center in Minneapolis, Minn., said the organization is thrilled to have Vujicic as a spokesperson. &ldquo;Nick is an amazing example of someone who has overcome the challenges of bullying and become even stronger,&rdquo; said Goldberg. &ldquo;He is confident, engaging, and inspiring, and is making a difference in the lives of millions of people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>PACER developed National Bullying Prevention Month in 2006, and in 2011 launched Unity Day, which brings communities together to unite against bullying on Wednesday, Oct. 22. Through his partnership with PACER, Vujicic will share his story and raise awareness of bullying prevention by speaking at schools, on social media, and in public service announcements. On Unity Day, Vujicic will send a message of support, hope, and unity by encouraging his fans around the world to wear orange in support of those who have been bullied. He will also host a special bullying prevention event which will be announced soon.</p>
<p>Speaking out about bullying is not new for the 31-year-old Vujicic, whose motivational speaking career spans more than 10 years. In his book, &ldquo;Stand Strong: You Can Overcome Bullying (and Other Stuff That Keeps You Down),&rdquo; Vujicic shares his experience of overcoming bullying and going on to create the life of his dreams. Now married with Kanae and father of son Kiyoshi he's loving life and living life without limits. &nbsp;Kanae and Nick are also inspiring people to not give up on love through Nick's next book 'Love Without Limits' (Nov. 18, 2014, WaterBrook Press).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having personally experienced all types of bullying for being &lsquo;different,&rsquo; I know what it feels like to be picked on and pushed around, so this cause is very important to me,&rdquo; said Vujicic, who is a native of Australia. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud to partner with PACER to help spread the word that bullying is not OK, and that there are things that teens and adults can do to address bullying and make our schools and communities safer.&rdquo;</p>
