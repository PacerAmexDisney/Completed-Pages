<p>October 22, 2014<br /><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong><br />
  Contact: PACER Center 952-838-9000, 800-53-PACER</p>
<p>PACER &amp; TWIGTALE  PARTNER ON CUSTOMIZABLE BOOK TO HELP YOUNG CHILDREN UNDERSTAND AND PREVENT  BULLYING</p>
<p>  In support of Unity Day, and in partnership with <a href="http://babble.com/" target="_blank">Babble.com</a>,  PACER is working&nbsp;with the experts at <u>Twigtale</u> to create a customizable  book to prevent bullying. The book helps young children understand how to be a  good friend and how to assert oneself when not being treated  respectfully.&nbsp; </p>
<p>  The  story highlights the critical concepts of turn-taking, sharing, reading social  cues, and empathizing.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Learning to Stand Tall and Act Brave&rdquo;  models respectful behavior and how to cope with challenges from friends.</p>
<p>  Bullying  can involve targeting and dominating a vulnerable peer with physical attacks,  name-calling, exclusion, manipulation, secret telling and spreading  rumors.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many factors impacting the development of  bullying behavior, as well as those with a tendency to be targeted, but early  intervention and better yet, <strong><em>prevention</em></strong>, by starting the learning  as babies and toddlers,&nbsp;can build lifelong advocacy skills.&nbsp; Parents  and teachers can make significant impact by consistently teaching and guiding  children to stop their bodies, notice the social cues of another, have empathy,  use their words, ask for help if needed, and problem solve.</p>
<p>  A leading child development expert scripted the easy-to-use  template, available on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.twigtale.com/books/bullying" target="_blank">Twigtale.com</a>.&nbsp;  You simply add photos and details to create the book personalized to your  child.&nbsp; A portion of proceeds will be donated to PACER! </p>
<p>Twigtale&nbsp;empowers parents to create  personalized stories to help their kids understand childhood transitions and  tough situations &ndash; such as welcoming a new sibling, moving, separation anxiety,  even explaining adoption or illness.&nbsp; Stories are scripted by child  development experts, and then personalized by parents with family photos and  details at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.twigtale.com/books/bullying" target="_blank">Twigtale.com</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our current titles span  transitions, anxieties, self-esteem and early learning. &nbsp;</p>
