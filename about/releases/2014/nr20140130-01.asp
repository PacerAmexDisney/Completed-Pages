<h1 align="center">FlagHouse, Inc. and the PACER Center Announce Partnership in Support of Bullying Awareness and Prevention</h1>
      <p>Hasbrouck Heights, NJ &ndash; January 27, 2014. FlagHouse, Inc. and PACER Center have announced a partnership in support of bullying awareness. Together they plan to help reduce and prevent bullying through a combination of educational materials, events, activities and games; plus specially-designed equipment that fosters teamwork and encourages children to cooperate and play together. </p>
      <p>According to the American Medical Association, approximately 3.7 million youths engage in, and more than 3.2 million are targets of, moderate or serious bullying each year. &quot;The PACER Center and FlagHouse, Inc. share the common goal of enhancing the quality of life for those within the special needs community. We look forward to working together to help prevent bullying, not only within the special needs community, but within every community,&quot; said Stephen Cooke, CEO of Flaghouse, Inc. </p>
      <p>In 2012, FlagHouse, Inc. launched its Bullying Awareness and Prevention Program - &ldquo;Play Well With Others...Be Active Against Bullying&quot;! - along with its partners the American Camp Association, Coordinated Approach to Child Health (CATCH&reg;), Jared Foundation, National AAPHERD, National PAL, and Project Adventure. The program helps to support bullying awareness programs across the country and was developed for grades 3-8. </p>
      <p>The PACER Center, in addition to its work on behalf of children and young adults with disabilities, has become a national and international leader in bullying prevention for all children by uniting, engaging, and educating students, parents, and teachers. In 2006, PACER founded the National Bullying Prevention Center&reg; and National Bullying Prevention Month. Last year, more than three million people in 195 countries downloaded PACER&rsquo;s bullying prevention resources for use in their communities. </p>
  <p>&quot;Bullying prevention is something that we need to address throughout the entire year,&quot; said Paula F. Goldberg, executive director and a founder of the PACER Center. &ldquo;We encourage everyone to take advantage of available resources. It's a first step toward helping children be safe at school, in the community, and online.&quot; </p>
