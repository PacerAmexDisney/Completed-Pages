<h2>Be a Superhero at PACER&rsquo;s Run, Walk, Roll Against Bullying Sept. 20</h2>
<p><strong>Minneapolis:</strong> Participants at PACER&rsquo;s Run, Walk, Roll Against Bullying on Sept. 20 in the Twin Cities will experience a rare opportunity to cross the finish line while wearing a superhero cape and being cheered on by Minnesota Vikings Cheerleaders and Viktor the Viking mascot. It&rsquo;s all part of the fun family event that raises awareness for bullying prevention and kicks off PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Month in October.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not every day you can make a statement about bullying prevention and be supported by professional cheerleaders and Viktor the Viking,&rdquo; said Julie Hertzog, director of PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center, which is based in Minneapolis. &ldquo;When you join PACER for this event, you&rsquo;ll not only have fun, but you&rsquo;ll be showing students who are bullied that there are superheroes in our communities who care and are committed to making our schools and communities safer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The 5th Annual Run, Walk, Roll Against Bullying, presented by American Dairy Queen and the Friends of PACER, features a 4-mile chip-timed run and 2-mile walk or roll, and offers an opportunity for adults and students to help raise awareness and funds to support bullying prevention. It will be held at Normandale Lake Park, Normandale Blvd. and W. 84th St., in Bloomington, Minn. Event check-in and onsite registration is at 9 a.m. at the Normandale Lake Bandshell, and free parking is available in the 8500 Tower Ramp located across W. 84th Street. The run and walk/roll begin at 10 a.m., followed by entertainment, music, and family fun. Participants will receive a complimentary T-shirt and superhero cape, and a Dilly&reg; Bar after the race. </p>
  <p>PACER developed National Bullying Prevention Month in 2006, and in 2011 launched Unity Day, which brings communities together to unite against bullying on Oct. 22. &ldquo;We are grateful for the support of the Minnesota Vikings and so many other great partners and volunteers who support bullying prevention,&rdquo; said Paula Goldberg, PACER&rsquo;s executive director. &ldquo;Together, we can help kids feel less alone.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The entry fee is $20 per person for adults, $10 for ages 7 to 16, and free for children 6 and under. Participants are encouraged to wear orange to the event and gather pledges from family, friends, co-workers, and local businesses. To register, visit PACER.org/bullying/nbpm/RunWalkRoll or call (952) 838-9000.</p>
