<h2>PACER Center to Encourage Passage of the Safe and Supportive Minnesota Schools Act</h2>
<p><strong>Minneapolis: </strong>Minnesota&rsquo;s 37-word law on bullying prevention is one of the shortest in the nation. The proposed Safe and Supportive Minnesota Schools Act would help protect Minnesota students from intentional negative and aggressive behavior, as well as provide resources for schools, parents and students.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying">PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center</a> is actively working toward the passage of the Safe and Supportive Schools Act in the 2014 legislative session.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>More than 13 million American children are bullied each year &ndash; that&rsquo;s one of every three students &ndash; and bullying significantly impacts the emotional and physical well-being of those involved. </strong>&nbsp;PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center receives calls from students, parents, and educators on a daily basis. Through workshops, online tools, and events last year, the center assisted thousands of individuals, and more than 3 million web visitors utilized PACER&rsquo;s bullying prevention resources. <br />
The Safe and Supportive Minnesota Schools Act will:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Outline protective policies for Minnesota students, including those with disabilities, to learn in a safe school environment</li>
  <li>Provide Minnesota educators, parents and students with the resources they need for bullying prevention and intervention</li>
  <li>Deliver the message that the Minnesota community takes bullying seriously</li>
</ul>
<p>The legislative session begins Feb. 25. Families, educators, and community members can take action by letting their state senators and representatives know their position on bullying prevention. For information on how to contact legislators in Minnesota, visit <a href="http://tinyurl.com/3fgwjnm">http://tinyurl.com/3fgwjnm</a>.

</ul>
<p>According to Julie Hertzog, Director of PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center, &ldquo;This must be Minnesota&rsquo;s year to put safeguards in place and protect its students from the devastating effects of bullying. We are asking families to do everything they can to encourage legislators to support this bill.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
