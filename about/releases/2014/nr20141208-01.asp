<h2>The Story of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer Shines Bright for 50 Years</h2>
 <h4> Holiday Classic Continues to Inspire Children to Celebrate Our Differences</h4>
<p>MINNEAPOLIS, Dec. 8, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- As families gather tomorrow night to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the animated TV special Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, PACER's National Bullying Prevention Center is encouraging parents and educators to use the classic story as an opportunity to start a conversation with their children about our differences.</p>
  <p>Each year, viewers follow Rudolph on an adventure that demonstrates how his unique red nose makes him 'shine bright.' But before Rudolph and his luminous red nose save the holidays, he is teased for being different from his peers&mdash;an issue that we all know still exists today.</p>
  <p>&quot;The story of Rudolph's shiny red nose has taught generations of children the importance of accepting each other's differences,&quot; said Virginia Herz, daughter of Robert L. May &ndash; author of the original Rudolph story. &quot;With the support of PACER's National Bullying Prevention Center, we're able to share the power of this timeless message, reminding children today to celebrate the things that make each of them unique.&quot;</p>
  <h4>ShineBright with Rudolph &amp; Friends</h4>
  
<p>Nearly 1 in 3 students (27.8%)<sup>1</sup> report being bullied during the school year, which is often sparked by differences like a child's looks or body shape. Parents can address the issue of bullying with their children and the relatable story of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer offers a creative way to facilitate a conversation about acceptance, respect and diversity.</p>
  <p>To help guide a discussion while watching Rudolph tomorrow night, parents and guardians are encouraged to download the ShineBright discussion and activity guide. Visit <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/shinebright/" target="_blank">www.PACER.org/ShineBright</a> to access a variety of tools, including discussion questions and an entertaining activity that will help children talk about the qualities that make them special.</p>
  <p>&quot;Over the past 50 years, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer has captured the hearts of viewers across the country as he spread his message of acceptance,&quot; said Julie Hertzog, PACER's National Bullying Prevention Center Director. &quot;When we embrace each other's differences and respect the unique traits that make each of us 'shine bright,' we help make the world a brighter place.&quot;</p>
  <h4>Rudolph's Shiny Red Nose to Save the Holiday</h4> 

  <p>This year, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer will air on Tuesday, Dec. 9 (8:00-9:00 PM, ET/PT) on the CBS Television Network. The heart-warming story of Rudolph is a beloved holiday tradition that has remained relevant for generations.</p>
  <p>As the story goes, when Rudolph's glowing nose is discovered, he is excluded from the Reindeer Games and runs away with Hermey the Elf, who is also deemed an outcast for wanting to become a dentist rather than make toys. After a series of adventures that showcases the pair's differences, they return home only to find that a snowstorm could keep Santa from delivering holiday toys to the children of the world. In the end, everyone embraces what makes Rudolph 'shine bright' and celebrates his unique trait that helps save the holiday each year.</p>
  <p>This classic story from the television special can now be enjoyed as an eBook &ndash; &quot;The Legend of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot; &ndash; and one dollar from each purchase will be donated to PACER's National Bullying Prevention Center. Additionally, all funds raised from the sale of each &quot;ShineBright&quot; t-shirt will be paid directly to PACER's National Bullying Prevention Center.
