<h2>The WE WILL Generation<strong>&trade;</strong>: PACER Launches National Peer-to-Peer Education Program to Help Students Prevent Bullying</h2>
<p><strong>Minneapolis: </strong>More than 13 million American children are bullied each year &ndash; that&rsquo;s one of every three students &ndash; and bullying significantly impacts the emotional and physical well-being of those involved. Educators, parents, and students are searching for solutions. Research shows that peer support is an effective way to stop bullying. <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying">PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center</a> recently launched the &ldquo;WE WILL Generation&trade;,&rdquo; a nationwide campaign and peer-to-peer curriculum that will provide students with the tools they need to speak up on behalf of their peers and prevent bullying in their schools, the community, and online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;We recognize that students are in the best position to have the greatest influence with their peers,&rdquo; said Julie Hertzog, director of PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center. &ldquo;Bullying directly affects students and they want to make a difference. The WE WILL Generation&trade; provides students with the tools to do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Launched in October 2013 during PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Month, the WE WILL Generation&trade; is student-led with adult support. It is built around the concept that older students can learn to teach younger students how to respond when they see a bullying situation. For example, high school students will present the five-part program to younger high school students or those in middle school. Members of sports teams will learn how to teach their younger counterparts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s students, like no other generation before them, have the opportunity to address bullying and change the culture,&rdquo; Hertzog said. &ldquo;Students want to do the right thing and what they need is education, support, and inspiration &ndash; and a practical program that equips them to be leaders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The WE WILL Generation&trade; offers schools a practical curriculum that can be quickly and easily implemented at no cost. All of the teaching tools and materials are web-based (<a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/wewillgen/">PACER.org/bullying/wewillgen</a>) for easy access. Students will be encouraged to submit creative content &ndash; videos in particular &ndash; that will be incorporated into the program on an ongoing basis.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When it comes to effectively responding to bullying, Hertzog believes that there is no simple one-step solution. Rather, it requires everyone to take a role in creating safer communities and schools, and students play an especially important role. &ldquo;When students &lsquo;own&rsquo; this issue they have incredible capacity to influence change,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The WE WILL Generation&trade; gives them an identity, a framework, and the knowledge they need to make an even greater impact.&rdquo; </p>
<p>PACER developed the program with support from Green Giant, as well as other corporations such as Disney.</p>
