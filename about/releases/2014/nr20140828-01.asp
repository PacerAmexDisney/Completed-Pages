<h2>Communities unite to support children and families during PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Month in October</h2>
<p>MINNEAPOLIS: More than 13 million children are bullied in America each year. Chances are that this is happening to a child that you care about. October is National Bullying Prevention Month, which was developed in 2006 by <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying">PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center</a> &nbsp;(<a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying">PACER.org/Bullying</a>) to raise awareness of the issue. &ldquo;October is a time when educators, students, parents and community members can unite to share an important message &ndash; that bullying is not acceptable behavior in their school and community,&rdquo; said Julie Hertzog, director of PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center in Minneapolis, Minn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The research shows that bullying can erode self-esteem, cause anxiety and depression, impact learning at school, and even lead to self-harm,&rdquo; Hertzog said. &ldquo;Bullying intervention and prevention is something in which everyone can play an important role. Every year, the momentum to address this issue grows, and more and more communities across the country come together to take action and respond to that concern in October, so students who are bullied will know that there&rsquo;s support available.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Community members can take action in several ways. They can use the free online resources from PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center, show their true colors by wearing orange on Oct. 22 for Unity Day, or become a &ldquo;Champion&rdquo; for the cause. National organizations also lend their support, including the National Education Association, American Federation for Teachers, the National PTA, and many others.</p>
  <p><strong>Web-based tools</strong><br />
  Last year, millions of people around the world used the National Bullying Prevention Center&rsquo;s resources and web-based tools to plan events, activities, outreach, and educational initiatives. These resources include information, toolkits, and more.</p>
  <p><strong>Plan an event </strong><br />
  Communities around the country celebrate National Bullying Prevention Month through creative events and initiatives. In collaboration with Facebook, PACER offers a step-by-step guide to planning your own community event. These resources are available at <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying">PACER.org/Bullying</a>.</p>
  <p><strong>Unity Day</strong><br />
  Students, teachers, and community members will wear orange and send a united message of support on <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/nbpm/unity-day.asp">Unity Day</a>, Wednesday, Oct. 22. Thanks to a partnership with CustomInk, supporters can wear the &ldquo;official&rdquo; Unite Against Bullying T-shirt. Custom Ink&rsquo;s &ldquo;Be Good to Each Other&rdquo; campaign encourages people to take a stand for kindness and tolerance. Proceeds support PACER&rsquo;s national bullying prevention programs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Taking part in Unity Day is a simple way to make a powerful statement,&rdquo; said Paula F. Goldberg, PACER Center&rsquo;s executive director. &ldquo;Anyone can join with us to &ldquo;Make It Orange and Make It End.&rdquo;</p>
  <p><strong>About PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center:</strong> Founded in 2006, PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center, actively leads social change, so that bullying is no longer considered an accepted childhood rite of passage.
