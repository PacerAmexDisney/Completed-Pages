<h2>PACER Center to screen award-winning documentary <em>Who Cares About Kelsey?</em></h2>


<p><strong>Minneapolis</strong>: PACER Center will offer a screening of the film <em>Who Cares About Kelsey? </em>by filmmaker Dan Habib from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. on Monday, April 24 at PACER Center, 8161 Normandale Blvd., Bloomington. This free workshop is for parents of children with disabilities. </p>
<p>Kelsey Carroll has one goal &mdash; to graduate from high school &mdash; and plenty of reasons why she shouldn&rsquo;t. She attends a school with one of the highest dropout rates in New Hampshire and has dealt with homelessness, sexual abuse, and ADHD. As a freshman, she didn&rsquo;t earn a single academic credit, but she did get suspended for dealing drugs. </p>
<p><em>Who Cares About Kelsey?</em> is the story of Kelsey&rsquo;s transformation from a defiant and disruptive &ldquo;problem student&rdquo; to a motivated and self-confident young woman. Along the way, critical figures in her personal and educational life shape her coming of age, and play important roles in an education revolution that&rsquo;s about empowering &mdash; not overpowering &mdash; youth with emotional and behavioral challenges.</p>
<p>A question-and-answer session with a PACER advocate will follow the film. For information and to view the trailer, visit <a href="http://www.whocaresaboutkelsey.com/">whocaresaboutkelsey.com</a>.</p>
<p>To register for this free workshop, contact PACER Center at (952) 838-9000 or (800) 537-2237 (toll free), email <a href="mailto:PACER@PACER.org">PACER@PACER.org</a>, or visit <a href="http://www.pacer.org/workshops/">PACER.org/workshops</a>.</p>
