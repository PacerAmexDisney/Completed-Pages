<p>October 4, 2017<br /><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong></p>
<h2>Clarisonic and PACER's National Bullying Prevention Center Partner to Stop Bullying</h2>
<p>REDMOND,  Wash., Oct. 2, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- October is National Bullying  Prevention Month, providing a national spotlight on an important issue facing a  reported one in five kids: bullying. <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/">PACER's National Bullying Prevention  Center</a>, the preeminent bullying prevention charity in the nation, is on a  mission to drive social change that ends bullying. The organization works to put important resources in the hands of parents, educators and students alike,  working to ensure that bullying is no longer an accepted childhood rite of  passage. Today PACER and <a href="http://www.clarisonic.com/">Clarisonic</a>&reg;, the creator of the #1  most-recommended skin-cleansing device by U.S. dermatologists*, announce a new  partnership and campaign designed to drive awareness and raise donations for  PACER's bullying prevention efforts. For every <a href="http://www.clarisonic.com/pacer">#CleanTheMean</a> social post  shared on Facebook or Instagram this year, Clarisonic will  donate $1 to PACER's National Bullying Prevention Center, up  to $100,000.</p>
<p>&quot;We  passionately believe that kids who feel safe, accepted, and supported will live  up to their full, brilliant potential,&quot; says Julie Hertzog, Director  of PACER's National Bullying Prevention Center. &quot;We are excited to join  forces with Clarisonic to launch the #CleanTheMean campaign&mdash;a compelling way to  spread awareness and encourage young people to be confident advocates for  themselves and others.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All of us  at Clarisonic are inspired by the work that PACER has done to prevent bullying  with education, advocacy and positivity,&quot; says Elisabeth Araujo,  President of Clarisonic. &quot;We're excited to help make the world a kinder,  more beautiful place, and hope people will join us simply by sharing one of our  #CleanTheMean stories or one of their own.&quot;</p>
<p>The money raised  through this campaign will help PACER's National Bullying Prevention Center  continue to put important resources in the hands of parents, educators and  students alike, including classroom lessons, school programming ideas, tips,  tools, and stories of people who have transitioned from being a bullying target  to a bullying prevention advocate.</p>
<p>Natalie, a  17-year-old from Los Angeles, CA, shares: &quot;The best thing I did was  reach out. I really felt like I was internalizing a lot of it and I was blaming  myself. I was ashamed to go to anyone to talk about it. But as soon as I  started opening up and telling people about it&mdash;telling my parents, telling a  teacher about it that I really trusted &mdash; that's when it started to get  better.&quot;</p>
