<h2><strong>TLC  NETWORK PRESENTS THE &ldquo;GIVE A LITTLE AWARDS&rdquo; IN PARTNERSHIP WITH REDBOOK  MAGAZINE AND PACER&rsquo;S NATIONAL BULLYING PREVENTION CENTER</strong></h2>
<p><strong>LOS ANGELES &ndash; September 19, 2017 </strong>&ndash;&nbsp; TLC Network will  host its first-ever <a href="https://www.tlc.com/tv-shows/give-a-little-tlc/">GIVE A LITTLE AWARDS</a> in  partnership with <a href="http://www.redbookmag.com/"><em>Redbook magazine</em></a> and <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/">PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center</a> to honor those who are making a difference in preventing  bullying. The awards will honor actress Brittany Snow, activist Monica Lewinsky,  network stars Dr. Jen Arnold and Bill Klein of THE LITTLE COUPLE and three  national contest winners inspiring their communities to address bullying: Natalie  Hampton (Sit With Us); Lauren Coaxum (Think Before You Type); and John Halligan  (Ryan&rsquo;s Story).&nbsp; </p>
<p>The  awards are an extension of GIVE A LITTLE TLC, the network&rsquo;s national multiplatform  campaign dedicated to empowering viewers to make a difference in the lives of  those in need by giving a little of their time, support and compassion. The ceremony will take  place on Wednesday, September 27 at Neuehouse in Los Angeles, to kick off National  Bullying Prevention Month which was initiated by PACER starting in October. TLC  star Chris Jacobs of LONG LOST FAMILY will serve as the event&rsquo;s emcee and other  notables will be both presenting and in attendance. </p>
<p>THE LITTLE COUPLE season 9 premieres tonight with  a special extended two-hour premiere starting at 8/7c on TLC. An GIVE A LITTLE  PSA featuring THE LITTLE COUPLE, available <a href="https://discovery.box.com/s/gs4ug7jtkgib1bg8waggt235lfuhx5ks">here</a>, will start airing on  9/25 on TLC and run through 10/22. </p>

She is also an ambassador for <a href="http://www.bystanderrevolution.org/">Bystander Revolution</a>, which offers practical,  crowdsourced advice about simple things individuals can do to defuse bullying  and shift the culture, as well as supports numerous organizations working on  this issue.
