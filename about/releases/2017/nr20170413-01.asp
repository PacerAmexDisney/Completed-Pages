<h2>PACER Center&rsquo;s Annual Benefit is May 13 featuring Jay Leno</h2>
<h4><em>This year&rsquo;s raffle grand prize is a once-in-a-lifetime trip to Napa Valley</em></h4>
<p><strong>Minneapolis: </strong>Emmy Award-winning comedian Jay Leno will be the featured performer at PACER Center&rsquo;s 35th Annual Benefit, presented by Starkey Hearing Technologies, on <strong>Saturday, May 13</strong> at the Minneapolis Convention Center. Leno is the former host of <em>The Tonight Show</em> and current star of CNBC&rsquo;s <em>Jay Leno&rsquo;s Garage</em>.</p>
<p>Following his performance, Leno will personally auction a tour for four people of his private collection of cars and motorcycles to benefit the work PACER does for families of children with disabilities and children who are bullied.</p>
<p>In addition to Leno&rsquo;s performance and PACER&rsquo;s legendary Live and Silent Auctions, guests have the opportunity to purchase Raffle tickets. The grand prize is an incredible once-in-a-lifetime trip for two people to Napa Valley. </p>
<p>The experience features a 14-course tasting menu with wine pairings at the amazing French Laundry Restaurant, a six-course tasting menu with wine pairings at the Michelin Star Auberge du Soleil Restaurant, and three nights at the four-diamond Meritage Resort and Spa!</p>
<p>The trip package will also include two round-trip, first class airline tickets on Sun Country from Minneapolis&ndash;St. Paul to Napa Valley (some date restrictions apply). Raffle tickets can be purchased by calling 952-838-9000. Additional information is available at <a href="http://www.pacer.org/benefit/">PACER.org/benefit</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are thrilled to have the opportunity to offer this amazing trip to Napa Valley,&rdquo; said Paula Goldberg, PACER&rsquo;s Executive Director. &ldquo;The Raffle is another way for guests to support PACER and they do not need to be present to win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Proceeds from the Annual Benefit support PACER&rsquo;s programs for children with disabilities and PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center, which was founded in 2006 so that bullying is no longer considered an accepted childhood rite of passage. Benefit tickets start at $75; visit <a href="http://www.pacer.org/benefit/">PACER.org/benefit</a> or call 952-838-9000. </p>
