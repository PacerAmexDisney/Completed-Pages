<h2>A night at the Oscars: Emagine Willow Creek to donate all proceeds from grand opening gala to PACER Center</h2>
<p><strong>Minneapolis</strong>: Emagine Entertainment, Inc. has completed renovations at Emagine Willow Creek in Plymouth and will celebrate with a grand opening ceremony on Thursday, March 9. The company has partnered with PACER Center and 100 percent of proceeds from ticket sales will support PACER&rsquo;s work for families of children with all disabilities as well as children who are bullied.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The event will begin at 6 p.m. at the theater, 9900 Shelard Pkwy., Plymouth. Guests will receive valet parking and have the opportunity to be photographed walking on the red carpet!</p>
<p>Grand opening festivities will include an official ribbon cutting ceremony, along with complimentary cocktails, heavy hors d&rsquo;ouevres and gourmet popcorn stations. Guests will then view their choice of one of this year&rsquo;s Academy Award nominees, including <em>Fences, Hidden Figures, La La Land, Lion, </em>or <em>Manchester by the Sea, </em>or a new release.</p>
<p>The partnership with PACER Center exemplifies the commitment Emagine has made to give back to local communities, according to Jon Goldstein, owner of Emagine Willow Creek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;PACER was chosen for their dedication to helping kids,&rdquo; Goldstein said. &ldquo;We have been deeply involved with children&rsquo;s charities for over 20 years and we look forward to continuing that tradition in Minnesota with PACER.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Paula Goldberg, executive director of PACER Center, said she was delighted to partner with Emagine. </p>
<p>&ldquo;This evening will be a great way to support the work PACER does for families in Minnesota and we&rsquo;re honored to have been chosen to be a part of this grand opening celebration,&rdquo; Goldberg said. </p>
