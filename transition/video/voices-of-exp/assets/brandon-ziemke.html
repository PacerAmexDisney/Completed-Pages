<p>Hi.</p>
<p> My name's Brandon Ziemke.</p>
<p> I grew up in Virginia.</p>
<p> When I was 3 I moved to Seattle, when I was 5 I moved here.</p>
<p> And, I pretty much knew I had a disability since the day I was born.</p>
<p> School is pretty good some days, sometimes.</p>
<p> I think that being friendly has been a big help.</p>
<p> I think overcoming obstacles sometimes.</p>
<p> I had to work on reading and writing and using my muscles.</p>
<p> Like I didn't know how to ride a bike until about 10 years ago.</p>
<p> I took it upon myself to learn and it just came, came to me yeah.</p>
<p> Like I think I've been trying ever since I was young to shoot a basket.</p>
<p> And, one day when I was in middle school I just finally did five shots in a row, five baskets, after a lot of misses and trying and trying and trying.</p>
<p> Yeah.</p>
<p> I didn't want to be special needs people.</p>
<p> I wanted to be in the community, I wanted to be in the normal classes, I wanted to be in the lunchroom with those people because I felt like that was important to me.</p>
<p> Yes I have very high expectations of myself.</p>
<p> There were teachers, the people at my job now, there are people at Kawasaki's, there are people here on campus.</p>
<p> I mean the list just goes on and on and on of people.</p>
<p> I have people here like Mara and Naomi who helped me learn to cook and clean and do laundry and do math and stuff like that.</p>
<p> Yeah.</p>
<p> I do washing dishes, I do all sorts of stuff in the kitchen around here.</p>
<p> And, it just kind of like community based.</p>
<p> You know, you have friends that you can talk to and stuff at work.</p>
<p> I'm good at communicating.</p>
<p> I'm good at getting things done as fast as possible.</p>
<p> There's always stuff to do.</p>
<p> There's never a boring moment at work.</p>
<p> Oh I feel really good about it.</p>
<p> And, I feel like I'm helping other people with disabilities get better, because they're people like me, that's why this college thing happened.</p>
<p> Yeah.</p>
<p> I really want to become an actor.</p>
<p> That's seriously something I'm considering doing some day.</p>
<p> I've been in plays before and I've done shows before.</p>
<p> And, I just want to someday get that a little bit better.</p>
<p> My dream job would be Vee Productions in Minneapolis that does Sesame Street Live.</p>
<p> I'd probably want to do like marketing or something like that.</p>
<p> Like if you're looking for a job now, don't give up because you're going to get a job that you love someday.</p>
