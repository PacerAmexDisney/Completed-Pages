&gt;&gt; Rachel Magario: I think the secret to success

00:00:14.996 --> 00:00:21.026 align:middle
for post secondary is not knowing
what career you're wanting to do.

00:00:21.026 --> 00:00:22.866 align:middle
It's knowing what you want to explore,

00:00:23.816 --> 00:00:29.066 align:middle
because you only know what you
want to do when you experience it.

00:00:31.226 --> 00:00:34.916 align:middle
I took all the opportunities I had in college.

00:00:35.116 --> 00:00:38.506 align:middle
Extracurricular activities give you experience,

00:00:39.106 --> 00:00:42.706 align:middle
give you a glimpse on what
to do and how to work.

00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:46.946 align:middle
It helps you build a work ethic.

00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:52.406 align:middle
Classes helps you to get the hard knowledge

00:00:53.016 --> 00:00:57.136 align:middle
but it doesn't give you what they
call sub skills, social skills.

00:00:57.856 --> 00:01:02.166 align:middle
So it's important to get
involved with social clubs.

00:01:03.606 --> 00:01:11.016 align:middle
Then the other important part in college is you
don't have an IP in a health support system,

00:01:11.376 --> 00:01:13.046 align:middle
especially if you're in a big college.

00:01:13.046 --> 00:01:18.296 align:middle
I was in a 30,000 campus, 30,000 student campus.

00:01:18.956 --> 00:01:25.166 align:middle
And it's important to not let people
discourage you on what you want to do.

00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:29.726 align:middle
It's important to finalize
in your professors to figure

00:01:29.726 --> 00:01:35.326 align:middle
out which classes will fit your learning
style best and not be afraid to drop bottom

00:01:35.326 --> 00:01:37.816 align:middle
that once they are not fitting your style.

00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:47.126 align:middle
And above all that, it's very important to be
able to get internships, jobs and opportunities,

00:01:47.126 --> 00:01:55.806 align:middle
before you get out of college because that is
the time to experience in a safe way and learn.

00:01:56.196 --> 00:02:04.606 align:middle
So when you get outside of college, what they
call the real world, you're able to find a job,

00:02:05.406 --> 00:02:11.686 align:middle
but, more than that, find a path for your
career; and college is the best place.

00:02:12.316 --> 00:02:18.786 align:middle
Don't be so worried about finishing
early, like everybody else,

00:02:19.236 --> 00:02:24.976 align:middle
but actually enjoying every
opportunity that college can afford.
