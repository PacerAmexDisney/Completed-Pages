&gt;&gt; Jonathan Mooney: First lesson is the
idea that different isn't deficient.

00:00:19.376 --> 00:00:22.876 align:middle
And that was a lesson that took
a while to learn, you know.

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:29.926 align:middle
If you hang out with the sort of language we
use when we talk about learning difference

00:00:29.926 --> 00:00:32.846 align:middle
or cognitive or physical differences,
it's fairly negative, you know.

00:00:32.846 --> 00:00:36.386 align:middle
Language-based learning disability,
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:44.626 align:middle
And often adults -- got to be frank about this
-- sort of use those words without thinking

00:00:44.796 --> 00:00:49.226 align:middle
and don't give young people a full understanding

00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:55.816 align:middle
of how these things we have called deficiencies
are differences in the truest sense of the word.

00:00:56.396 --> 00:00:57.716 align:middle
You know, look at dyslexia.

00:00:57.876 --> 00:01:00.456 align:middle
You know, that's a difference.

00:01:00.556 --> 00:01:03.006 align:middle
It's got good things about it;
it's got bad things about it.

00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:06.736 align:middle
You know, I don't write or read well.

00:01:06.736 --> 00:01:11.086 align:middle
That's something I'm not naive about, but
there's a lot of research that shows that folks

00:01:11.086 --> 00:01:15.336 align:middle
with dyslexia are more creative, more
entrepreneurial than the general population.

00:01:15.436 --> 00:01:19.476 align:middle
Same goes with ADD and Asperger's
and anxiety and depression.

00:01:19.686 --> 00:01:22.296 align:middle
These are very complex human phenomena.

00:01:22.696 --> 00:01:28.196 align:middle
And I had people in my life in my childhood and
in particular during my transition to adulthood

00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:33.846 align:middle
who helped me understand that and helped me
understand that I am a part of a continuum

00:01:33.846 --> 00:01:38.776 align:middle
of human difference, that diversity is a
strength, that our culture, our schools,

00:01:38.776 --> 00:01:43.836 align:middle
our workplaces need diversity in every
single shape and form, and this is something

00:01:43.836 --> 00:01:45.476 align:middle
to be proud of and not ashamed of.

00:01:45.806 --> 00:01:50.676 align:middle
That was an important lesson for me.

00:01:50.966 --> 00:01:51.346 align:middle
Second lesson.

00:01:51.346 --> 00:01:54.236 align:middle
Sounds simple, but hard to do.

00:01:54.316 --> 00:02:00.346 align:middle
I had to learn to ask for
help and be okay getting help.

00:02:00.386 --> 00:02:05.476 align:middle
You know, during my early
school challenges and struggles,

00:02:05.906 --> 00:02:11.846 align:middle
I wasn't comfortable getting help even after
I was diagnosed with a learning disability,

00:02:12.206 --> 00:02:17.706 align:middle
even into my late adolescent, early adulthood,
I had a hard time using accommodations --

00:02:17.706 --> 00:02:20.676 align:middle
books on tape, time extensions for exams.

00:02:21.026 --> 00:02:23.596 align:middle
And when I didn't use those
accommodations, which were my right

00:02:23.596 --> 00:02:26.386 align:middle
by law, I struggled and I failed.

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:29.306 align:middle
And getting over that sense of shame,

00:02:29.606 --> 00:02:33.046 align:middle
understanding that getting help
is something everybody does.

00:02:33.046 --> 00:02:38.646 align:middle
Every human being, whether you have a
disability or not, we are interdependent.

00:02:38.706 --> 00:02:40.636 align:middle
We lift each other up.

00:02:40.636 --> 00:02:44.396 align:middle
And that was an important
thing for me to understand.

00:02:44.926 --> 00:02:48.946 align:middle
And, you know, I get more
help now than I've ever done.

00:02:49.396 --> 00:02:51.316 align:middle
You know, I write books for a living.

00:02:51.456 --> 00:02:53.106 align:middle
You know, I spell at a third grade level.

00:02:53.426 --> 00:02:54.336 align:middle
How do I do that?

00:02:54.336 --> 00:02:56.916 align:middle
Well, you know, I married my spellchecker.

00:02:57.046 --> 00:03:03.496 align:middle
You know, I [laughs], you know, and, you know,
my wife, who was my girlfriend in college,

00:03:03.496 --> 00:03:05.866 align:middle
would read papers I wrote,
would read books to me.

00:03:05.866 --> 00:03:08.006 align:middle
My mom would spell check things.

00:03:08.006 --> 00:03:10.286 align:middle
You know, there's no shame in that.

00:03:10.286 --> 00:03:15.726 align:middle
And that also is something I
continue into my professional life.

00:03:15.726 --> 00:03:18.526 align:middle
You know, getting help and getting
accommodations isn't something

00:03:18.526 --> 00:03:20.686 align:middle
that stops when school stops.

00:03:20.686 --> 00:03:22.816 align:middle
It's something we bring into the world of work.

00:03:22.816 --> 00:03:25.626 align:middle
It's something we bring into
our interpersonal relationships.

00:03:25.906 --> 00:03:27.706 align:middle
It's a lifelong skill.

00:03:28.016 --> 00:03:33.816 align:middle
And I've mastered that skill and I wish
I would have mastered that skill sooner.

00:03:35.516 --> 00:03:44.500 align:middle
