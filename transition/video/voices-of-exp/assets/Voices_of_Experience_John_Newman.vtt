&gt;&gt; John Newman: Hey everyone.

00:00:11.456 --> 00:00:12.466 align:middle
My name is John Newman.

00:00:12.516 --> 00:00:16.286 align:middle
I'm an assistant technology specialist
here at PACER Simon Technology Center.

00:00:16.696 --> 00:00:20.186 align:middle
And I'll be telling you a little bit more
kind of about myself and the work I do

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:22.936 align:middle
and also offer a little bit of advice.

00:00:22.936 --> 00:00:27.246 align:middle
So I think what's interesting is I became
aware of my disability not too young,

00:00:27.296 --> 00:00:30.606 align:middle
but definitely probably around
like third or fourth grade.

00:00:31.046 --> 00:00:35.056 align:middle
I just had trouble kind of sitting still or
paying attention when other people could.

00:00:35.056 --> 00:00:39.986 align:middle
And I also really noticed that writing
in general was really hard for me.

00:00:40.216 --> 00:00:42.926 align:middle
So that's kind of when I
really started to notice it.

00:00:43.276 --> 00:00:45.496 align:middle
But I didn't really feel that
different when I was young.

00:00:46.136 --> 00:00:48.576 align:middle
What's interesting too is
I feel like when you look

00:00:48.576 --> 00:00:50.806 align:middle
at your disability there's
both strengths and weaknesses.

00:00:51.176 --> 00:00:56.236 align:middle
And one thing for me was when you have an
attention difficulty, school is an environment

00:00:56.236 --> 00:00:58.466 align:middle
where it really demands you
to be paying attention a lot.

00:00:58.846 --> 00:01:02.046 align:middle
And when you have a disability, a lot of
times you're thinking of other things,

00:01:02.046 --> 00:01:04.416 align:middle
other things that are much
more interesting to you.

00:01:04.976 --> 00:01:08.146 align:middle
So it was really hard for me to
really stay motivated about things

00:01:08.146 --> 00:01:09.946 align:middle
that didn't capture my attention.

00:01:09.946 --> 00:01:13.686 align:middle
Because if it doesn't capture my attention or
some of my passion, it's really hard for me

00:01:13.686 --> 00:01:15.886 align:middle
to devote a lot of my time and energy to it.

00:01:15.886 --> 00:01:20.666 align:middle
So that kind of made school a struggle, because
there was always a balance between focusing

00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:25.076 align:middle
and being motivated on something that
didn't necessarily kind of captivate me.

00:01:25.336 --> 00:01:29.706 align:middle
So that's a skill that I had to develop was,
you know, just because I'm not interested

00:01:29.706 --> 00:01:31.606 align:middle
in this doesn't mean I shouldn't
work hard for it.

00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:35.856 align:middle
I think what was cool with my parents was they
actually helped me understand my disability

00:01:35.856 --> 00:01:36.936 align:middle
at a scientific level.

00:01:37.276 --> 00:01:41.866 align:middle
Sometimes when you act different than other
people, that can make you feel really strange.

00:01:42.246 --> 00:01:45.906 align:middle
And what my parents just let me know is that
it was just a difference in my brain chemistry.

00:01:45.906 --> 00:01:49.456 align:middle
It didn't make me a bad person
or an unintelligent person,

00:01:49.726 --> 00:01:51.476 align:middle
it just made me act a little bit differently.

00:01:51.546 --> 00:01:53.816 align:middle
And as soon as I started
to learn more about that,

00:01:54.156 --> 00:01:56.186 align:middle
I was able to accept myself a little bit more.

00:01:56.186 --> 00:01:57.086 align:middle
So that really helped.

00:01:57.686 --> 00:02:01.976 align:middle
I think high expectations is interesting for
both the parent, and then also as an individual.

00:02:02.776 --> 00:02:04.876 align:middle
Sometimes if you're not succeeding in school,

00:02:04.876 --> 00:02:07.516 align:middle
it's really easy for your
expectations to change for yourself.

00:02:07.876 --> 00:02:11.616 align:middle
And I think the role of a parent is
to really help you keep those us.

00:02:12.016 --> 00:02:15.966 align:middle
So sometimes a parent can really help
someone see a future for yourself

00:02:15.966 --> 00:02:18.286 align:middle
that you currently can't see
because you're really struggling.

00:02:18.686 --> 00:02:22.066 align:middle
So my parents I think always really
helped me keep my eye on the ball.

00:02:22.526 --> 00:02:27.466 align:middle
And something that was really important that
they told me is that school is the only time

00:02:27.466 --> 00:02:29.396 align:middle
in your life where you have
to be good at everything.

00:02:29.776 --> 00:02:30.746 align:middle
You have to be good at math.

00:02:30.796 --> 00:02:31.776 align:middle
You have to be good at writing.

00:02:31.776 --> 00:02:33.516 align:middle
You have to be good at sports.

00:02:33.766 --> 00:02:35.806 align:middle
And it's really not like that in the real world.

00:02:35.806 --> 00:02:38.676 align:middle
The real world is where you
find hey what am I good at?

00:02:38.746 --> 00:02:39.776 align:middle
What motivates me?

00:02:40.056 --> 00:02:44.006 align:middle
And how can I bring that to a job,
to a hobby, and that's something

00:02:44.006 --> 00:02:45.476 align:middle
that they really helped me keep in mind.

00:02:45.476 --> 00:02:47.676 align:middle
And that was a big motivator going forward.

00:02:48.006 --> 00:02:52.486 align:middle
So I was fortunate enough to go to college,
and college, kind of like I was saying earlier,

00:02:52.486 --> 00:02:54.826 align:middle
is where you really get to
explore what interests you.

00:02:55.246 --> 00:02:58.216 align:middle
And in college I became fascinated
with technology

00:02:58.296 --> 00:03:00.376 align:middle
and how people interact with technology.

00:03:00.796 --> 00:03:04.886 align:middle
So when I graduated I still had that passion
of looking at technology, how people interact

00:03:04.886 --> 00:03:07.096 align:middle
with it, how technology benefits people.

00:03:07.436 --> 00:03:11.806 align:middle
And I saw this job as a really cool opportunity
to give back, learn a lot about people,

00:03:11.946 --> 00:03:14.566 align:middle
how they interact with technology,
and I'm having a lot of fun

00:03:14.566 --> 00:03:16.346 align:middle
and kind of growing each day with it.

00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:20.046 align:middle
So that's kind of something that really
motivated me to get into this field.

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:23.466 align:middle
I think the big thing you've got to
look at is what are your strengths.

00:03:23.556 --> 00:03:26.666 align:middle
That's something that every
successful person, you know,

00:03:26.666 --> 00:03:29.186 align:middle
quotes disability or not, has to ask themselves.

00:03:29.556 --> 00:03:33.026 align:middle
So if you're in high school, I think it's
your job to really think about you know,

00:03:33.096 --> 00:03:35.976 align:middle
when I wake up every day, what
do I want to bring to this world?

00:03:36.366 --> 00:03:38.256 align:middle
And that's where you look at your strengths.

00:03:38.256 --> 00:03:40.136 align:middle
So when you wake up, is it your creativity?

00:03:40.456 --> 00:03:42.326 align:middle
Is it the way you interact with people?

00:03:42.326 --> 00:03:44.346 align:middle
Is it kind of some of your science smarts?

00:03:44.346 --> 00:03:49.276 align:middle
Really discover what it is that excites and
that you feel really positive and good about

00:03:49.566 --> 00:03:51.666 align:middle
and kind of push and pursue that thing.

00:03:51.956 --> 00:03:55.616 align:middle
Because a lot of people in life can, you
know, just take any job or do anything.

00:03:55.616 --> 00:03:58.586 align:middle
But I think the people that are really
successful and happy find things

00:03:58.926 --> 00:04:01.276 align:middle
that really connects with them
and really motivates them.

00:04:01.276 --> 00:04:03.906 align:middle
So even at high school you
can start to think about that.

00:04:03.906 --> 00:04:07.436 align:middle
Because that's going to really help
predict those next steps in your life.

00:04:08.516 --> 00:04:17.500 align:middle
