&gt;&gt; Jonathan Mooney: So my
name is Jonathan Mooney,

00:00:13.416 --> 00:00:17.506 align:middle
and I'm originally from Los Angeles, California.

00:00:17.826 --> 00:00:24.136 align:middle
And you know I had a very tumultuous
and painful school experience

00:00:24.136 --> 00:00:26.216 align:middle
as somebody who learned differently.

00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:32.896 align:middle
I was the kid who spent most of the day
hiding out in the hallway with the janitor.

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:36.266 align:middle
I was the kid who grew up on a first name basis

00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:38.416 align:middle
with Shirley the receptionist
in the principal's office.

00:00:39.056 --> 00:00:42.776 align:middle
You know I was the kid who
spent most of the day hiding

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:44.856 align:middle
in the bathroom to escape reading out loud.

00:00:45.506 --> 00:00:47.116 align:middle
I didn't learn to read until I was 12.

00:00:47.776 --> 00:00:56.016 align:middle
Was diagnosed with dyslexia and ADD or attention
deficit disorder when I was in fourth grade.

00:00:56.566 --> 00:01:01.046 align:middle
And I actually dropped out of
school for two years in sixth grade.

00:01:01.046 --> 00:01:05.076 align:middle
And that year I had a plan for suicide.

00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:09.876 align:middle
So I had a lot of low expectations
that surrounded me in my life.

00:01:09.946 --> 00:01:12.656 align:middle
I was told that I would flip
burgers for a living.

00:01:12.656 --> 00:01:15.166 align:middle
I was told that I would be
a high school dropout.

00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:16.156 align:middle
I'd be incarcerated.

00:01:16.706 --> 00:01:21.536 align:middle
And eventually I ended up kind of beating those
odds and going to college and being a writer

00:01:21.536 --> 00:01:26.556 align:middle
and being an advocate for people with
cognitive and physical differences.

00:01:26.556 --> 00:01:31.036 align:middle
So while school started as a difficult
experience, it's something that I managed

00:01:31.036 --> 00:01:33.606 align:middle
to change and reimagine in my own life.

00:01:33.826 --> 00:01:40.096 align:middle
And I have to say, coming to an understanding
of myself as person with a learning difference

00:01:40.096 --> 00:01:42.196 align:middle
or disability what was an important moment.

00:01:42.586 --> 00:01:50.126 align:middle
Before I was diagnosed, I really thought
of myself as the stupid, crazy, lazy kid.

00:01:50.436 --> 00:01:56.276 align:middle
Those were messages I was getting from
teachers, from peers, from my own father.

00:01:56.986 --> 00:02:02.476 align:middle
And being able to understand myself differently,
know that the reason I struggled with reading

00:02:02.476 --> 00:02:05.956 align:middle
and writing wasn't because I was dumb
but because my brain was different.

00:02:06.376 --> 00:02:07.146 align:middle
That was important.

00:02:07.146 --> 00:02:10.266 align:middle
Or understanding the reason that I
had a hard time sitting still wasn't

00:02:10.266 --> 00:02:16.976 align:middle
because I was you know, bad or trying to be
disruptive, but because my brain was different.

00:02:16.976 --> 00:02:18.826 align:middle
That was an important moment for me.

00:02:19.346 --> 00:02:21.596 align:middle
That moment happened around
fourth and fifth grade.

00:02:21.596 --> 00:02:24.916 align:middle
It happened because of a
wonderful teacher in my life.

00:02:24.916 --> 00:02:25.566 align:middle
I'll never forget him.

00:02:25.566 --> 00:02:27.386 align:middle
His name was Mr. Rosenbaum.

00:02:27.386 --> 00:02:32.606 align:middle
He invited me and my mom into his office
one day, and he said hey Jonathan,

00:02:32.606 --> 00:02:33.886 align:middle
you remind me a lot of my daughter.

00:02:34.286 --> 00:02:37.506 align:middle
And my daughter went off to
college, and my daughter is dyslexic.

00:02:37.976 --> 00:02:42.436 align:middle
And I told that story because it's
really important that I understood

00:02:42.436 --> 00:02:46.886 align:middle
that having a learning difference
isn't anything to be ashamed of.

00:02:47.106 --> 00:02:52.826 align:middle
That dyslexia and ADD aren't deficiencies but
differences in the truest sense of the word.

00:02:53.346 --> 00:02:55.726 align:middle
And Mr. Rosenbaum had that belief.

00:02:55.726 --> 00:03:00.546 align:middle
And I encourage others when they think about
themselves or when they engage with young people

00:03:00.806 --> 00:03:07.726 align:middle
with differences to celebrate these difference
as opposed to make folks feel ashamed of them.

00:03:08.516 --> 00:03:15.500 align:middle
