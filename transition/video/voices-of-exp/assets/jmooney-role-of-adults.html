<p>Yeah, adults played a big role in my life.</p>
<p> You know, I mentioned that I went off to go to college.</p>
<p> I actually went off to an ivy league school, Brown University, where I graduated with an honors degree in English and literature.</p>
<p> And I was able to do that because I was somebody who really never gave up, somebody who was resilient and persevered.</p>
<p> And if I heard "no," I turned it into a "yes.</p>
<p>" And that was a really important skill to develop.</p>
<p> And I think of it as a skill.</p>
<p> You know, I don't read well, I don't write well, but I don't give up.</p>
<p> And that is more important than those other sort of academic skills.</p>
<p> Even in my own life today.</p>
<p> And so those skills were built by two people in my life, and I will talk about them briefly.</p>
<p> One was my mom.</p>
<p> I have to celebrate her.</p>
<p> You know, my mom faced some challenges in her own life.</p>
<p> She was a very resilient woman.</p>
<p> She raised my brothers and two sisters on welfare in San Francisco.</p>
<p> She didn't do well in school, struggled academically, probably undiagnosed learning disabled herself.</p>
<p> And a lot of folks didn't take her seriously because she had this very funny, high-pitched voice like Mickey Mouse.</p>
<p> But people dismissed my mom at their own peril.</p>
<p> Because my mother, she cursed like a truck driver.</p>
<p> And if you were a principal or a teacher doing wrong by her son, you did not want cursing Mickey Mouse in your office.</p>
<p> But that is really where my mom was, every day, fighting for me.</p>
<p> Believing in me, and really giving me that message to never give up.</p>
<p> To be resilient.</p>
<p> So I owe a lot of my journey to my mom.</p>
<p> I also owe most of my journey to educators in my life.</p>
<p> Teachers.</p>
<p> And I had some teachers that didn't do right by me, but I had more who believed in me and supported me.</p>
<p> And the list is long.</p>
<p> It is Mr.</p>
<p> R in third and fourth grade, that I mentioned, that teacher who helped me think of myself differently.</p>
<p> Mr.</p>
<p> Towner was a high school guidance counselor that I had, who really gave me this message that things get better.</p>
<p> And that is really important to understand.</p>
<p> One of the reasons I didn't give up in high school, even before then, I had a plan for suicide when I was 12, one of the reasons I didn't give up and follow through on that was because of people like Mr.</p>
<p> Towner, who said that things get better.</p>
<p> You know? The traits that lead to life success are often not the traits that lead to school success.</p>
<p> There is more Fortune 500 CEOs run by C-students than valedictorians.</p>
<p> And often kids who struggle in school can thrive in life.</p>
<p> And that was a real message that Mr.</p>
<p> Towner gave me every day.</p>
<p> And the last person I want to mention was another educator, a man named Mr.</p>
<p> Starkey.</p>
<p> This was a teacher I met in high school, actually toward my end of high school, senior year.</p>
<p> He was an AP English teacher.</p>
<p> I always had a passion for stories, and literature, but I was no good at reading and writing.</p>
<p> And he took a risk on me, and let me into this AP class that I had no right to be in.</p>
<p> And I remember one of the things that he believed in deeply was that every single human being had a strength or a talent.</p>
<p> And so he dedicated much of his class to asking people what were they good at? What were there talents? What were their strengths? And that was a hard question for me to answer for a long time.</p>
<p> You know, all I ever heard in my IEP meetings were what was wrong with me.</p>
<p> I never heard anything about what was right with me.</p>
<p> So Mr.</p>
<p> Starkey would ask me, and I would say, "You know what? I'm not good at anything.</p>
<p>" You know, I'm not good at spelling, I'm not good at writing.</p>
<p> And he, one day I will never forget, I was 17, he said "Jonathan, in my class screw spelling, screw what you're not good at, and build your life on your talents.</p>
<p>" And that was a real lesson to me.</p>
<p> Because what I've learned now is that, you know, people who persevere, who have grit, tenacity, they're people who are living a life based on passion, purpose and strength.</p>
<p> And they have organized their education and their life around those things, and it has helped them transcend those low expectations that helped me transcend those low expectations, and I owe a lot of that to those people in my life, my mom, and those educators, like Mr.</p>
<p> Starkey.</p>
