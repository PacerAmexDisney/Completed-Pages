<p>So my name is Jonathan Mooney, and I'm originally from Los Angeles, California.</p>
<p> And you know I had a very tumultuous and painful school experience as somebody who learned differently.</p>
<p> I was the kid who spent most of the day hiding out in the hallway with the janitor.</p>
<p> I was the kid who grew up on a first name basis with Shirley the receptionist in the principal's office.</p>
<p> You know I was the kid who spent most of the day hiding in the bathroom to escape reading out loud.</p>
<p> I didn't learn to read until I was 12.</p>
<p> Was diagnosed with dyslexia and ADD or attention deficit disorder when I was in fourth grade.</p>
<p> And I actually dropped out of school for two years in sixth grade.</p>
<p> And that year I had a plan for suicide.</p>
<p> So I had a lot of low expectations that surrounded me in my life.</p>
<p> I was told that I would flip burgers for a living.</p>
<p> I was told that I would be a high school dropout.</p>
<p> I'd be incarcerated.</p>
<p> And eventually I ended up kind of beating those odds and going to college and being a writer and being an advocate for people with cognitive and physical differences.</p>
<p> So while school started as a difficult experience, it's something that I managed to change and reimagine in my own life.</p>
<p> And I have to say, coming to an understanding of myself as person with a learning difference or disability what was an important moment.</p>
<p> Before I was diagnosed, I really thought of myself as the stupid, crazy, lazy kid.</p>
<p> Those were messages I was getting from teachers, from peers, from my own father.</p>
<p> And being able to understand myself differently, know that the reason I struggled with reading and writing wasn't because I was dumb but because my brain was different.</p>
<p> That was important.</p>
<p> Or understanding the reason that I had a hard time sitting still wasn't because I was you know, bad or trying to be disruptive, but because my brain was different.</p>
<p> That was an important moment for me.</p>
<p> That moment happened around fourth and fifth grade.</p>
<p> It happened because of a wonderful teacher in my life.</p>
<p> I'll never forget him.</p>
<p> His name was Mr.</p>
<p> Rosenbaum.</p>
<p> He invited me and my mom into his office one day, and he said hey Jonathan, you remind me a lot of my daughter.</p>
<p> And my daughter went off to college, and my daughter is dyslexic.</p>
<p> And I told that story because it's really important that I understood that having a learning difference isn't anything to be ashamed of.</p>
<p> That dyslexia and ADD aren't deficiencies but differences in the truest sense of the word.</p>
<p> And Mr.</p>
<p> Rosenbaum had that belief.</p>
<p> And I encourage others when they think about themselves or when they engage with young people with differences to celebrate these difference as opposed to make folks feel ashamed of them.</p>
