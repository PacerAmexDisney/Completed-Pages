&gt;&gt; Dao Xiong: Well, I think the
biggest challenge is to achieve

00:00:16.426 --> 00:00:20.716 align:middle
in reading, writing, and mathematics.

00:00:21.756 --> 00:00:29.776 align:middle
These pose an egregious challenge for her
to achieve those, achieve these things.

00:00:30.996 --> 00:00:41.656 align:middle
However, she has managed herself to learn
as she can, and by the time that finish,

00:00:41.856 --> 00:00:59.156 align:middle
she finished high school, she was at the
lower level of grade school in those subjects.

00:00:59.456 --> 00:01:14.826 align:middle
She loved children and this was her
first exploration to see if she can go

00:01:14.826 --> 00:01:27.186 align:middle
to some class or, you know, do some visual,
to do some casual work related to [inaudible].

00:01:29.236 --> 00:01:39.026 align:middle
But I understand that this area
requires particular skills to do.

00:01:39.756 --> 00:01:47.876 align:middle
So, however, she still loved those
children and this area is still part

00:01:47.876 --> 00:01:52.316 align:middle
of her goal when she's in high school.

00:01:53.636 --> 00:02:05.146 align:middle
Well, our culture aspect we try to graph
and have his or her own family by themself.

00:02:05.936 --> 00:02:14.486 align:middle
So for her, she will be more dependent
on the family and siblings' support.

00:02:15.366 --> 00:02:27.296 align:middle
So I expect that she will have a family,
but that's not for sure at this time.

00:02:27.676 --> 00:02:36.996 align:middle
However, because of her disability,
I understand that she can be herself

00:02:37.806 --> 00:02:48.286 align:middle
because I have seen many young men and
young women being single all along.

00:02:48.616 --> 00:02:58.796 align:middle
Other cultural aspect that having a
child living with someone else is taboo

00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:06.216 align:middle
because it's shown that, it's shown the
lack of parent's role and responsibility.

00:03:07.536 --> 00:03:17.706 align:middle
But however, I know that there is an
option there that she can live with us,

00:03:17.706 --> 00:03:24.546 align:middle
she can live alone with support,
or she can be in a group home.
