00:00:11.216 --> 00:00:19.226 align:middle
&gt;&gt; A child with a disability, it is
different than the way we see it.

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:24.106 align:middle
Again, earlier I mentioned
that school is a choice.

00:00:24.106 --> 00:00:25.236 align:middle
It wasn't mandatory.

00:00:25.576 --> 00:00:33.926 align:middle
So if a child had a severe disability, the
parents tend to keep the child at home.

00:00:34.246 --> 00:00:36.706 align:middle
They would not send to school.

00:00:37.176 --> 00:00:45.596 align:middle
And the school system was not equipped
to teach children with a disability.

00:00:45.656 --> 00:00:53.306 align:middle
So it is a new concept to have a child,
particular child with a severe disability

00:00:53.576 --> 00:00:57.916 align:middle
or developmental delay, to
have them in a school setting.

00:00:57.916 --> 00:01:04.146 align:middle
It is something that many families struggle
with, and have difficulty understanding.

00:01:04.616 --> 00:01:15.296 align:middle
I also should mention that there are some
things that we call a visible disability,

00:01:15.296 --> 00:01:24.486 align:middle
an invisible disability, and when it is
invisible disability, things such as ADHD,

00:01:25.256 --> 00:01:32.186 align:middle
attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder, it is very difficult for parents

00:01:32.236 --> 00:01:36.426 align:middle
to understand those kinds of disabilities.

00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:43.256 align:middle
And frequently what you see is the
parents are not really of a mind

00:01:43.316 --> 00:01:48.016 align:middle
to understand there is a disability.

00:01:48.366 --> 00:01:57.666 align:middle
Because the word disability itself translates
completely different in our language.

00:01:57.976 --> 00:02:05.606 align:middle
Disability is known for someone who
is, for instance, physically disabled.

00:02:05.956 --> 00:02:08.036 align:middle
Or cognitively disabled.

00:02:08.086 --> 00:02:14.206 align:middle
A lot of other things that, you
know, we recognize as having a delay.

00:02:14.506 --> 00:02:21.846 align:middle
Maybe, as I mentioned, invisible disability.

00:02:22.176 --> 00:02:23.926 align:middle
It is not recognized.

00:02:23.926 --> 00:02:29.006 align:middle
And families struggle understanding how
that is considered to be a disability.

00:02:29.616 --> 00:02:33.076 align:middle
So it has, you know, a completely
different connotation

00:02:33.076 --> 00:02:37.616 align:middle
than what we know here or how we see disability.

00:02:38.976 --> 00:02:46.806 align:middle
Transition is another aspect
that many families struggle with.

00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:56.936 align:middle
You know, in a way, it has a negative
connotation because usually here, as we say,

00:02:57.026 --> 00:03:04.436 align:middle
we want our children to, or young adults,
to transition into being independent.

00:03:04.436 --> 00:03:08.816 align:middle
That is, that alone, that
statement, it is, you know,

00:03:08.816 --> 00:03:15.806 align:middle
typically I find the parents
say independent from who?

00:03:15.856 --> 00:03:18.476 align:middle
From your own parents?

00:03:18.476 --> 00:03:24.996 align:middle
We came from a culture that kids
can stay home as long as they want.

00:03:24.996 --> 00:03:34.596 align:middle
It is seen as something positive to have the
kids at home, and young adults, you know, 25,

00:03:34.666 --> 00:03:40.606 align:middle
26, living at home, helping parents,
helping, you know, younger siblings.

00:03:40.936 --> 00:03:45.756 align:middle
It is something that is very
positive and very reinforced.

00:03:46.316 --> 00:03:53.746 align:middle
And that all has been shifted, reversed,
and here we say we want our kids to be

00:03:53.746 --> 00:03:56.286 align:middle
out of home at the age of 18 or so.

00:03:56.656 --> 00:04:01.756 align:middle
And so it is an idea that it is foreign to them.

00:04:02.196 --> 00:04:03.976 align:middle
And they struggle.

00:04:04.116 --> 00:04:11.846 align:middle
They struggle and they are not really open
minded to the whole services of a transition.

00:04:12.316 --> 00:04:20.476 align:middle
And sometimes when I sit in IEP and
individual education plan with a parent,

00:04:20.476 --> 00:04:27.796 align:middle
I see when we get o the part of the transition,
the parents are not really so much interested

00:04:27.796 --> 00:04:32.396 align:middle
in it just because transition
is not part of the culture.

00:04:32.396 --> 00:04:39.846 align:middle
It is not part of the, you know, parents would
rather have, you know, close by their kids.

00:04:40.196 --> 00:04:41.486 align:middle
Or their young adults.

00:04:41.486 --> 00:04:44.536 align:middle
And that support of the young siblings.

00:04:45.056 --> 00:04:46.806 align:middle
The younger ones.

00:04:47.156 --> 00:04:55.976 align:middle
So it is foreign term and you know, many
times they struggle to really understand

00:04:55.976 --> 00:05:00.476 align:middle
and comprehend what transition
means and what it stands for.

00:05:00.476 --> 00:05:03.116 align:middle
What is it supposed to do and all that?

00:05:03.556 --> 00:05:15.016 align:middle
But I see some parents that are really
open minded too, and explore opportunities

00:05:15.016 --> 00:05:19.476 align:middle
that the kids can receive through
transition, transition class.

00:05:19.916 --> 00:05:27.516 align:middle
But overwhelmingly, the majority I would
say, parents, it is a part of the services

00:05:27.556 --> 00:05:30.176 align:middle
that they really don't understand

00:05:30.176 --> 00:05:38.866 align:middle
or maybe sometimes they would
be kind of hesitant to explore.

00:05:39.516 --> 00:05:47.500 align:middle
