&gt;&gt; Rachel Magario: My mom
was key on my development.

00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:20.516 align:middle
She first let me know that I could do it.

00:00:21.076 --> 00:00:27.376 align:middle
so, anytime that something happen that
could make me think I couldn't do it,

00:00:28.086 --> 00:00:34.436 align:middle
my mom will step in even though she was really,
really afraid, she will step in and help me out.

00:00:35.936 --> 00:00:47.116 align:middle
Parents are pivotal in the life of a child
but even more if that child has a disability.

00:00:48.276 --> 00:00:53.146 align:middle
And, if you have a child with
blindness, the best thing you can do

00:00:53.146 --> 00:00:58.436 align:middle
for them is number one believe in
them, number two create environments

00:00:58.716 --> 00:01:01.076 align:middle
where they can learn and get information.

00:01:01.546 --> 00:01:04.096 align:middle
That doesn't matter if it's
important information or not,

00:01:04.646 --> 00:01:10.796 align:middle
but just fill their brains
with every information you can.

00:01:10.796 --> 00:01:17.926 align:middle
And then, third is to infuse in their hearts
that they can be whoever they want to be

00:01:18.546 --> 00:01:30.036 align:middle
and let them learn the process of advocating and
learning that is their right to have information

00:01:30.216 --> 00:01:32.816 align:middle
and participate like everybody else.
