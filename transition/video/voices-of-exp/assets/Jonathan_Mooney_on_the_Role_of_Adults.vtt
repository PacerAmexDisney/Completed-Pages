00:00:10.836 --> 00:00:15.186 align:middle
&gt;&gt; Yeah, adults played a big role in my life.

00:00:15.986 --> 00:00:19.136 align:middle
You know, I mentioned that
I went off to go to college.

00:00:19.136 --> 00:00:22.546 align:middle
I actually went off to an ivy
league school, Brown University,

00:00:22.546 --> 00:00:25.116 align:middle
where I graduated with an honors
degree in English and literature.

00:00:25.116 --> 00:00:30.876 align:middle
And I was able to do that because I
was somebody who really never gave up,

00:00:31.176 --> 00:00:35.326 align:middle
somebody who was resilient and persevered.

00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:39.196 align:middle
And if I heard "no," I turned it into a "yes."

00:00:39.356 --> 00:00:42.696 align:middle
And that was a really important
skill to develop.

00:00:42.696 --> 00:00:43.876 align:middle
And I think of it as a skill.

00:00:43.876 --> 00:00:47.746 align:middle
You know, I don't read well, I don't
write well, but I don't give up.

00:00:47.746 --> 00:00:52.506 align:middle
And that is more important than
those other sort of academic skills.

00:00:52.506 --> 00:00:54.036 align:middle
Even in my own life today.

00:00:54.536 --> 00:00:59.266 align:middle
And so those skills were built by two people
in my life, and I will talk about them briefly.

00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:00.576 align:middle
One was my mom.

00:01:00.576 --> 00:01:02.456 align:middle
I have to celebrate her.

00:01:02.456 --> 00:01:06.466 align:middle
You know, my mom faced some
challenges in her own life.

00:01:06.686 --> 00:01:08.156 align:middle
She was a very resilient woman.

00:01:08.556 --> 00:01:12.226 align:middle
She raised my brothers and two
sisters on welfare in San Francisco.

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:18.286 align:middle
She didn't do well in school,
struggled academically,

00:01:18.316 --> 00:01:20.916 align:middle
probably undiagnosed learning disabled herself.

00:01:21.346 --> 00:01:25.566 align:middle
And a lot of folks didn't take her
seriously because she had this very funny,

00:01:25.796 --> 00:01:27.486 align:middle
high-pitched voice like Mickey Mouse.

00:01:27.936 --> 00:01:30.856 align:middle
But people dismissed my mom at their own peril.

00:01:31.086 --> 00:01:33.626 align:middle
Because my mother, she cursed
like a truck driver.

00:01:33.966 --> 00:01:37.896 align:middle
And if you were a principal or a
teacher doing wrong by her son,

00:01:37.896 --> 00:01:40.796 align:middle
you did not want cursing
Mickey Mouse in your office.

00:01:41.156 --> 00:01:43.946 align:middle
But that is really where my mom
was, every day, fighting for me.

00:01:43.946 --> 00:01:48.306 align:middle
Believing in me, and really giving
me that message to never give up.

00:01:48.406 --> 00:01:49.926 align:middle
To be resilient.

00:01:50.256 --> 00:01:53.996 align:middle
So I owe a lot of my journey to my mom.

00:01:54.496 --> 00:01:58.996 align:middle
I also owe most of my journey
to educators in my life.

00:01:58.996 --> 00:01:59.566 align:middle
Teachers.

00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:02.696 align:middle
And I had some teachers that
didn't do right by me,

00:02:02.696 --> 00:02:06.226 align:middle
but I had more who believed
in me and supported me.

00:02:06.656 --> 00:02:09.086 align:middle
And the list is long.

00:02:09.086 --> 00:02:11.786 align:middle
It is Mr. R in third and
fourth grade, that I mentioned,

00:02:11.786 --> 00:02:15.096 align:middle
that teacher who helped me
think of myself differently.

00:02:15.096 --> 00:02:19.396 align:middle
Mr. Towner was a high school
guidance counselor that I had,

00:02:19.396 --> 00:02:23.116 align:middle
who really gave me this message
that things get better.

00:02:23.116 --> 00:02:25.176 align:middle
And that is really important to understand.

00:02:25.556 --> 00:02:29.966 align:middle
One of the reasons I didn't give up
in high school, even before then,

00:02:29.966 --> 00:02:34.756 align:middle
I had a plan for suicide when I was 12, one
of the reasons I didn't give up and follow

00:02:34.756 --> 00:02:39.936 align:middle
through on that was because of people like
Mr. Towner, who said that things get better.

00:02:40.276 --> 00:02:40.636 align:middle
You know?

00:02:40.866 --> 00:02:46.366 align:middle
The traits that lead to life success are often
not the traits that lead to school success.

00:02:46.646 --> 00:02:51.606 align:middle
There is more Fortune 500 CEOs run
by C-students than valedictorians.

00:02:51.956 --> 00:02:55.296 align:middle
And often kids who struggle
in school can thrive in life.

00:02:55.296 --> 00:02:58.746 align:middle
And that was a real message that
Mr. Towner gave me every day.

00:02:58.936 --> 00:03:04.926 align:middle
And the last person I want to mention was
another educator, a man named Mr. Starkey.

00:03:04.926 --> 00:03:06.896 align:middle
This was a teacher I met in high school,

00:03:06.896 --> 00:03:09.236 align:middle
actually toward my end of
high school, senior year.

00:03:09.686 --> 00:03:11.246 align:middle
He was an AP English teacher.

00:03:11.696 --> 00:03:16.116 align:middle
I always had a passion for
stories, and literature,

00:03:16.116 --> 00:03:18.336 align:middle
but I was no good at reading and writing.

00:03:18.596 --> 00:03:22.966 align:middle
And he took a risk on me, and let me into
this AP class that I had no right to be in.

00:03:22.966 --> 00:03:25.646 align:middle
And I remember one of the things
that he believed in deeply was

00:03:25.646 --> 00:03:28.116 align:middle
that every single human being
had a strength or a talent.

00:03:28.616 --> 00:03:32.636 align:middle
And so he dedicated much of his class
to asking people what were they good at?

00:03:32.916 --> 00:03:34.106 align:middle
What were there talents?

00:03:34.106 --> 00:03:34.996 align:middle
What were their strengths?

00:03:35.296 --> 00:03:38.146 align:middle
And that was a hard question for
me to answer for a long time.

00:03:38.496 --> 00:03:41.826 align:middle
You know, all I ever heard in my IEP
meetings were what was wrong with me.

00:03:41.826 --> 00:03:43.996 align:middle
I never heard anything about
what was right with me.

00:03:44.326 --> 00:03:46.876 align:middle
So Mr. Starkey would ask me,
and I would say, "You know what?

00:03:46.876 --> 00:03:48.056 align:middle
I'm not good at anything."

00:03:48.236 --> 00:03:50.036 align:middle
You know, I'm not good at
spelling, I'm not good at writing.

00:03:50.506 --> 00:03:57.486 align:middle
And he, one day I will never forget, I was 17,
he said "Jonathan, in my class screw spelling,

00:03:58.036 --> 00:04:02.436 align:middle
screw what you're not good at, and
build your life on your talents."

00:04:02.966 --> 00:04:04.706 align:middle
And that was a real lesson to me.

00:04:04.756 --> 00:04:10.846 align:middle
Because what I've learned now is that, you know,
people who persevere, who have grit, tenacity,

00:04:11.246 --> 00:04:16.556 align:middle
they're people who are living a life
based on passion, purpose and strength.

00:04:17.106 --> 00:04:21.546 align:middle
And they have organized their education
and their life around those things,

00:04:21.546 --> 00:04:24.376 align:middle
and it has helped them transcend
those low expectations

00:04:24.376 --> 00:04:29.426 align:middle
that helped me transcend those low expectations,
and I owe a lot of that to those people

00:04:29.426 --> 00:04:34.756 align:middle
in my life, my mom, and those
educators, like Mr. Starkey.

00:04:35.516 --> 00:04:43.500 align:middle
