&gt;&gt; Jonathan Mooney: Yeah, I mean,
first thing is to understand.

00:00:17.876 --> 00:00:27.066 align:middle
And then live deeply the idea that people
don't have disabilities from my perspective.

00:00:27.296 --> 00:00:30.146 align:middle
They experience disabilities in environments

00:00:30.146 --> 00:00:33.126 align:middle
that can't embrace or celebrate
their differences.

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:39.616 align:middle
And the thing that truly disables
people is being treated and marginalized

00:00:39.926 --> 00:00:41.786 align:middle
and belittled for having differences.

00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:47.806 align:middle
And it's the sense of shame, and it's the sense
of being less than that is truly disabling.

00:00:48.286 --> 00:00:53.476 align:middle
So the more parents can invest in
building that positive self-concept.

00:00:53.856 --> 00:01:00.026 align:middle
The more you can work with schools to change
the learning environment and not the kid

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:02.326 align:middle
through accommodations and modifications.

00:01:02.646 --> 00:01:10.126 align:middle
And the more that we can build a culture that
reframes these as differences to be celebrated.

00:01:10.306 --> 00:01:13.566 align:middle
That's the foundation of a
positive life transition.

00:01:13.846 --> 00:01:20.716 align:middle
Second thing I would say is we got to help
kids, young people get good at something.

00:01:20.946 --> 00:01:26.076 align:middle
You know, there's this tension in the world of
disability where we spend so much time talking

00:01:26.076 --> 00:01:29.486 align:middle
about what's wrong with kids that we really
lose sight of what's right with them.

00:01:29.926 --> 00:01:33.836 align:middle
And more and more what we know about
people who live lives that thrive.

00:01:34.316 --> 00:01:38.856 align:middle
And what I mean by that is folks
who go off and have meaningful work.

00:01:39.156 --> 00:01:42.286 align:middle
They live in a meaningful community
and have deep relationships.

00:01:42.606 --> 00:01:46.166 align:middle
People who go off to achieve
those things are often people

00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:48.976 align:middle
who have built a sort of strength-based pathway.

00:01:49.356 --> 00:01:51.806 align:middle
They're people who have found out
what they're passionate about.

00:01:51.806 --> 00:01:52.636 align:middle
What they're good at.

00:01:52.636 --> 00:01:53.536 align:middle
What they're interested in.

00:01:53.536 --> 00:01:58.076 align:middle
And have aligned their education
and employment around those things.

00:01:58.386 --> 00:02:01.456 align:middle
They're folks who have sort of
accepted the things they can't change.

00:02:01.456 --> 00:02:02.686 align:middle
I can't change my spelling.

00:02:02.686 --> 00:02:03.826 align:middle
I can't change my reading.

00:02:04.036 --> 00:02:06.836 align:middle
And they've really scaled the
things that they're good at.

00:02:06.836 --> 00:02:09.316 align:middle
And I was supported by that by my mom.

00:02:09.316 --> 00:02:12.346 align:middle
I was supported by it by
many educators in my life.

00:02:12.346 --> 00:02:17.356 align:middle
And that was an important building
block of my own transition.

00:02:18.476 --> 00:02:22.776 align:middle
You know, and the last thing I
would say, and I said it before.

00:02:22.776 --> 00:02:27.136 align:middle
But it really needs to be repeated.

00:02:27.136 --> 00:02:31.816 align:middle
Give young people a sense
that they're not alone.

00:02:32.176 --> 00:02:38.176 align:middle
That they're a part of a broad community
of people who learn and live differently.

00:02:38.256 --> 00:02:43.656 align:middle
And the more that we know that, the more that
we can have courage in raising our hands.

00:02:43.656 --> 00:02:44.796 align:middle
And sharing our stories.

00:02:44.796 --> 00:02:46.286 align:middle
And asking for help.

00:02:46.286 --> 00:02:49.866 align:middle
And telling people that I have
dyslexia, which I'm proud to say.

00:02:49.866 --> 00:02:50.206 align:middle
Or ADD.

00:02:50.206 --> 00:02:53.186 align:middle
We can have courage in that.

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:54.966 align:middle
You know, and that's a big moment.

00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:57.646 align:middle
You know, I went to college.

00:02:57.646 --> 00:02:59.446 align:middle
I transferred to college.

00:02:59.946 --> 00:03:03.426 align:middle
And I remember that I felt
I was the only one there.

00:03:03.526 --> 00:03:07.656 align:middle
And because I felt that I was the only kid with
a learning disability there, I almost left.

00:03:07.656 --> 00:03:09.656 align:middle
I almost quit many, many different times.

00:03:09.656 --> 00:03:13.866 align:middle
What I learned over my time in college
was I was far from the only one there.

00:03:14.296 --> 00:03:19.576 align:middle
That there are many people like me in every
business and every school all around the world.

00:03:19.896 --> 00:03:23.646 align:middle
And the more that we can have that shared
sense of being a part of a larger community,

00:03:23.986 --> 00:03:27.146 align:middle
the more that we can understand
that we're not alone.

00:03:27.276 --> 00:03:29.586 align:middle
The more resilient and perseverant we can be.
