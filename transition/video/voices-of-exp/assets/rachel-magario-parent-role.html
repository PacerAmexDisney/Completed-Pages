<p>My mom was key on my development.</p>
<p> She first let me know that I could do it.</p>
<p> so, anytime that something happen that could make me think I couldn't do it, my mom will step in even though she was really, really afraid, she will step in and help me out.</p>
<p> Parents are pivotal in the life of a child but even more if that child has a disability.</p>
<p> And, if you have a child with blindness, the best thing you can do for them is number one believe in them, number two create environments where they can learn and get information.</p>
<p> That doesn't matter if it's important information or not, but just fill their brains with every information you can.</p>
<p> And then, third is to infuse in their hearts that they can be whoever they want to be and let them learn the process of advocating and learning that is their right to have information and participate like everybody else.</p>
