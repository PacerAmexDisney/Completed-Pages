&gt;&gt; Rachel Magario: Well I think the major
thing is attitude, the major component

00:00:19.116 --> 00:00:24.366 align:middle
of being successful and overcoming
difficulties is attitude.

00:00:25.036 --> 00:00:30.046 align:middle
Attitude is 60% of your battle.

00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:36.096 align:middle
If you can get up and look
at a glass half full instead

00:00:36.096 --> 00:00:40.056 align:middle
of half empty, then, you're on the right track.

00:00:41.426 --> 00:00:45.786 align:middle
What helped me was I have
a very supportive mother.

00:00:46.996 --> 00:00:50.276 align:middle
My dad wasn't supportive but
he also didn't stay in the way.

00:00:51.206 --> 00:00:57.806 align:middle
So, what happened was I was able to learn
how to advocate for myself really early on.

00:00:58.416 --> 00:01:03.636 align:middle
My mother often forced teachers
to have to discuss

00:01:03.726 --> 00:01:09.506 align:middle
with me what would be our plan
of action and not with her.

00:01:09.506 --> 00:01:12.276 align:middle
There was a time that she wasn't even available.

00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:19.476 align:middle
She would skip being in the picture
to force teachers to work with me.

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:27.536 align:middle
She taught me a lot of critical thinking
and process at home so I could learn

00:01:27.896 --> 00:01:33.306 align:middle
and detect what was needed for me to learn.

00:01:33.306 --> 00:01:41.046 align:middle
And then, just working with people, being able
to explain to them that you have a problem

00:01:41.046 --> 00:01:42.936 align:middle
and you might not know what that problem was.

00:01:43.386 --> 00:01:45.916 align:middle
And then, together, we can work it out.
