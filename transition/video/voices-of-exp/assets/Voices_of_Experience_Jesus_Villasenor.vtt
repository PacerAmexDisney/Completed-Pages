&gt;&gt; Jesus Villasenor: My name is Jesus
Villasenor I am originally from Mexico.

00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:24.176 align:middle
I am advocate at PACER Center and I have a son
with a disability, with a learning disability.

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:30.656 align:middle
And, it must have been, I think, when my
son was in second grade in elementary school

00:00:31.526 --> 00:00:35.486 align:middle
when realized, when we realized
that something was not going right

00:00:35.486 --> 00:00:42.136 align:middle
because my son was coming home crying,
just get in his room and closing the door.

00:00:42.726 --> 00:00:48.326 align:middle
And, we started to get calls from the
teachers complaining about a bad attitude

00:00:48.876 --> 00:00:50.906 align:middle
that my son was having at school.

00:00:51.736 --> 00:00:55.236 align:middle
So, that was the first indication
that things were not going well.

00:00:55.526 --> 00:01:04.246 align:middle
And, through, an evaluation, which wasn't easy
because my child is, he was an excellent reader

00:01:04.756 --> 00:01:11.676 align:middle
but then we realized when we make evaluation
that he had, his problem was with numbers.

00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:19.316 align:middle
And so, he was identified at the end of second
school year with a learning disability and ADHD.

00:01:19.316 --> 00:01:26.516 align:middle
When we learned about my son's
disability, it was really a surprise.

00:01:27.136 --> 00:01:33.216 align:middle
But, because of my lack of knowledge, I really
didn't have any, we didn't have an impact.

00:01:33.216 --> 00:01:40.296 align:middle
I really didn't know in the beginning
what it really meant for him and for us,

00:01:40.746 --> 00:01:42.736 align:middle
the fact that he had a learning disability.

00:01:43.376 --> 00:01:51.656 align:middle
And, to tell you the truth, it was even hard,
harder also for teachers because I have this,

00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:58.056 align:middle
I think that this thing about being, learning
disability being a nonvisible disability,

00:01:58.356 --> 00:02:04.436 align:middle
it just and because our child was
intelligent and actually bright.

00:02:04.996 --> 00:02:10.046 align:middle
It was hard for the teachers to understand
that he had a learning disability.

00:02:10.656 --> 00:02:16.796 align:middle
So, for my expectations, I always
kept high expectations for my child.

00:02:17.246 --> 00:02:20.856 align:middle
But, I knew that I needed
to get more information.

00:02:21.276 --> 00:02:26.446 align:middle
And, that's actually when I started in contact
with PACER to get information that I needed

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:31.856 align:middle
about what a learning disability meant and
actually about, to learn about our rights.

00:02:33.986 --> 00:02:38.186 align:middle
The challenges that his disability
presented for him were tremendous.

00:02:38.746 --> 00:02:41.136 align:middle
It was actually brutal.

00:02:41.136 --> 00:02:49.846 align:middle
We saw how this fun loving child was
getting beating down by the burden

00:02:49.846 --> 00:02:53.796 align:middle
of his disability and because
of his intelligence.

00:02:54.366 --> 00:02:58.326 align:middle
He was very aware that he
was not learning the way

00:02:58.996 --> 00:03:02.216 align:middle
that his peers were learning
or at the same pace.

00:03:02.626 --> 00:03:04.406 align:middle
And that was devastating for him.

00:03:04.966 --> 00:03:12.376 align:middle
But, including also the fact of how he was
treated differently by his teachers and he felt

00:03:12.376 --> 00:03:20.646 align:middle
so vulnerable to how weak his
achievement in school was that he really,

00:03:21.136 --> 00:03:26.286 align:middle
if it wasn't because the friends that
he had and loved while in school,

00:03:26.286 --> 00:03:32.066 align:middle
I think that he would've been,
he would've tried to drop out.

00:03:33.956 --> 00:03:43.416 align:middle
Fortunately, well, what we did with our child to
help him through the school years was to insist

00:03:43.416 --> 00:03:51.866 align:middle
to him that his personality himself
he was bigger than his disability.

00:03:51.956 --> 00:04:00.416 align:middle
And so if he was not being successful in school
that, not to let his disability to define him.

00:04:00.926 --> 00:04:05.556 align:middle
And so, we kept cheering him and
he still didn't believe us because,

00:04:05.556 --> 00:04:08.406 align:middle
I guess what they need is the
validation of their peers.

00:04:09.186 --> 00:04:14.346 align:middle
Fortunately, in our case, our child
discovered his passion for art.

00:04:14.986 --> 00:04:20.936 align:middle
And, he's a tremendous musician
and very good at visual arts.

00:04:21.356 --> 00:04:27.026 align:middle
And, he in the end decided for arts and
he attended college and actually graduated

00:04:27.026 --> 00:04:30.086 align:middle
with honors with a degree in illustration.

00:04:30.856 --> 00:04:38.826 align:middle
And, he found a job right away after
graduating from college where he got

00:04:38.826 --> 00:04:43.396 align:middle
to do what he says that he was born to do.

00:04:43.946 --> 00:04:49.546 align:middle
And, he's a very successful illustrator and
now he's doing all sorts of graphic arts

00:04:49.546 --> 00:04:52.406 align:middle
for a very prestigious advertising firm.

00:04:52.856 --> 00:04:56.616 align:middle
So, it's what people say, you know,

00:04:56.616 --> 00:05:01.236 align:middle
when you love what you're doing you
do have to work a day in your life.

00:05:01.916 --> 00:05:05.696 align:middle
And, that is the fortune
that we have with our son.

00:05:06.216 --> 00:05:10.676 align:middle
He's gainfully employed,
successful professional.

00:05:11.016 --> 00:05:17.726 align:middle
And what I keep telling parents and my message
to all the parents is that try and find,

00:05:17.796 --> 00:05:24.376 align:middle
talk to the children and find what is
that passion what is that thing in life

00:05:24.376 --> 00:05:27.186 align:middle
that they are good at that they
have the strength to build upon?

00:05:28.276 --> 00:05:30.486 align:middle
And it makes the whole difference in the world.

00:05:31.756 --> 00:05:38.406 align:middle
So, again, my advice to parents, Latino parents
specifically, and all parents in general is

00:05:38.896 --> 00:05:46.656 align:middle
to talk to the children but also to learn
to listen to them and use imagination

00:05:46.656 --> 00:05:50.196 align:middle
and try to find out what is that
thing that moves their children.

00:05:50.196 --> 00:05:53.806 align:middle
What is that thing that your
child feels fantastic for?

00:05:53.856 --> 00:06:00.106 align:middle
And, we live, fortunately, we live
in a country that where everything,

00:06:00.106 --> 00:06:03.366 align:middle
all the dreams can happen
when you work hard enough.

00:06:03.736 --> 00:06:07.956 align:middle
And again, when you have a passion
for something, that's the way to go.
