&gt;&gt; Hassan Samantar: Hi.

00:00:12.196 --> 00:00:13.806 align:middle
My name is Hassan Samantar.

00:00:14.046 --> 00:00:16.746 align:middle
I am a Pacer multicultural advocate.

00:00:17.346 --> 00:00:26.036 align:middle
I do work with communities of color from
East Africa, meaning Somali families,

00:00:26.746 --> 00:00:34.106 align:middle
in many different aspects -- but mostly with
their education, their children's education.

00:00:34.656 --> 00:00:37.936 align:middle
It's completely different circumstances.

00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:44.546 align:middle
We have - the country we
came from, our homeland,

00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:46.946 align:middle
the education system is completely different.

00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:53.466 align:middle
There are a lot of services that we were
not afforded or we didn't have back home

00:00:53.516 --> 00:00:58.636 align:middle
that are - families can, I think, here.

00:00:59.236 --> 00:01:02.316 align:middle
And it's very complicated.

00:01:02.606 --> 00:01:08.496 align:middle
It's a - very difficult circumstances
for a lot of families

00:01:08.596 --> 00:01:13.956 align:middle
who either might have a language barrier
or a, you know, cultural barrier.

00:01:14.486 --> 00:01:18.336 align:middle
So it's completely different circumstances.

00:01:18.336 --> 00:01:22.686 align:middle
It's a lot more complicated.

00:01:22.886 --> 00:01:32.216 align:middle
And it's - it takes awhile for families to
overcome all the barriers that services here

00:01:32.326 --> 00:01:36.976 align:middle
in this country that are
available for the families.

00:01:38.296 --> 00:01:43.016 align:middle
Education is very important.

00:01:43.556 --> 00:01:53.476 align:middle
It's - and somehow it's the other way -
the only way, I should say out of poverty.

00:01:53.776 --> 00:02:03.496 align:middle
Education back home was very important,
and parents strive sometimes -

00:02:03.866 --> 00:02:10.246 align:middle
commute in a very long distance to be able

00:02:10.316 --> 00:02:13.976 align:middle
to have their children have
opportunity of education.

00:02:14.446 --> 00:02:17.756 align:middle
However, there is a lot of
differences that should be noted.

00:02:18.366 --> 00:02:23.416 align:middle
For instance, education wasn't compulsory.

00:02:23.906 --> 00:02:30.046 align:middle
A family could keep their children home if
they, for some reason, maybe were not able

00:02:30.086 --> 00:02:36.346 align:middle
to afford the transportation
or for many other reasons.

00:02:36.736 --> 00:02:39.266 align:middle
But education wasn't compulsory.

00:02:39.266 --> 00:02:43.396 align:middle
It was a choice that the families have.

00:02:43.686 --> 00:02:50.976 align:middle
In another aspect that's very important in
terms of education in this country and compared

00:02:50.976 --> 00:02:57.906 align:middle
to our homelands is the fact that the
school have the sole responsibility

00:02:58.746 --> 00:03:06.886 align:middle
of educating the children -- you know,
since the parents' extent in terms

00:03:06.886 --> 00:03:13.546 align:middle
of school involvement was just to bring
their kids to school and drop them off.

00:03:13.546 --> 00:03:15.856 align:middle
We didn't have a transportation system.

00:03:15.896 --> 00:03:17.896 align:middle
There was no transportation system available,

00:03:17.896 --> 00:03:21.156 align:middle
so the parents were responsible,
bringing their kids to school.

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:27.696 align:middle
But as far as of - in terms of the
extent of involvement, that was it,

00:03:27.796 --> 00:03:34.006 align:middle
and the school was responsible
for educating the kids.

00:03:34.006 --> 00:03:40.126 align:middle
So that, at times, can be misleading to
many of the - especially, the newcomers --

00:03:40.126 --> 00:03:43.416 align:middle
the new American Somali families
-- when here we say,

00:03:43.416 --> 00:03:49.766 align:middle
"We want you to be involved
in your child's education."

00:03:50.346 --> 00:03:52.616 align:middle
It's a very tall task.

00:03:52.616 --> 00:03:58.606 align:middle
It's a very complicated system and may not
really understand where to start or even what

00:03:58.666 --> 00:04:02.186 align:middle
that means -- involvement, school involvement.

00:04:02.186 --> 00:04:03.206 align:middle
What does that mean?

00:04:03.986 --> 00:04:12.666 align:middle
So I usually, you know, recommend to the
educators to be a little bit more specific

00:04:12.666 --> 00:04:16.226 align:middle
or give them a task that the parents can handle.

00:04:16.546 --> 00:04:19.316 align:middle
Now remember, there might be a language barrier.

00:04:19.316 --> 00:04:24.896 align:middle
They might be - not be able to help
their parents in terms of homework.

00:04:25.266 --> 00:04:29.206 align:middle
So it's very different.

00:04:29.386 --> 00:04:35.976 align:middle
It's - and it's completely difficult at times
for the parents to understand that concept.
