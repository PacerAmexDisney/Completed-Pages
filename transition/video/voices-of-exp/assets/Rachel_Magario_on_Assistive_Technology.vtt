&gt;&gt; Rachel Magario: Assistive
technology is amazing and it plays

00:00:13.396 --> 00:00:16.816 align:middle
until today a big part of my success.

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:24.676 align:middle
I don't think I could be an Assistive
Technology Specialist today without technology.

00:00:25.246 --> 00:00:30.036 align:middle
I wouldn't have been able to go through
design school without technology

00:00:30.646 --> 00:00:32.676 align:middle
or business school without technology.

00:00:32.946 --> 00:00:44.376 align:middle
My first piece of technology was a typewriter
and it was key to help me do my homework

00:00:44.996 --> 00:00:49.366 align:middle
and be able to communicate with other people
when I didn't have anybody to transcribe braille

00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:55.596 align:middle
for my teachers so that really sped the process.

00:00:56.536 --> 00:01:03.636 align:middle
Unfortunately, typewriters are now
sophisticated and every time you made an error

00:01:03.896 --> 00:01:10.156 align:middle
until I got the electric one that had the
automatic eraser, didn't really work out.

00:01:10.326 --> 00:01:11.986 align:middle
I had to start all over again.

00:01:12.356 --> 00:01:15.856 align:middle
So computers are a big part of my life

00:01:15.856 --> 00:01:21.766 align:middle
and I think I carry my Mac Air probably
everywhere I go and my iPhone is definitely

00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:24.206 align:middle
with me all the time, even when I'm asleep.

00:01:26.246 --> 00:01:31.916 align:middle
Assistive technology, especially with
the phones today just with one tiny piece

00:01:31.976 --> 00:01:41.636 align:middle
of technology I can take photos and figure out
what I'm taking photos of and I can scan papers

00:01:41.686 --> 00:01:44.816 align:middle
and have the text be converted for me to read.

00:01:45.086 --> 00:01:55.166 align:middle
I can scan barcodes and figure out what product
I'm looking at and I can do color ID for colors.

00:01:55.636 --> 00:02:01.526 align:middle
It's not very great but at least it gives
me an idea if it's dark or light colors.

00:02:02.236 --> 00:02:05.776 align:middle
Assistive technology has
helped me connect to the world

00:02:06.446 --> 00:02:11.366 align:middle
with Internet, with so many other people.

00:02:12.056 --> 00:02:14.756 align:middle
It has helped me to be a little--

00:02:14.756 --> 00:02:19.636 align:middle
learn more about others and learn
what others have done before me.

00:02:20.056 --> 00:02:29.706 align:middle
I think the Internet has done that for everybody
but especially for me has given me another door

00:02:29.856 --> 00:02:36.926 align:middle
and another tool in my toolbox so I
can really connect with other people.
