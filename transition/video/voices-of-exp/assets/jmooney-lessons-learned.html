<p>First lesson is the idea that different isn't deficient.</p>
<p> And that was a lesson that took a while to learn, you know.</p>
<p> If you hang out with the sort of language we use when we talk about learning difference or cognitive or physical differences, it's fairly negative, you know.</p>
<p> Language-based learning disability, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.</p>
<p> And often adults -- got to be frank about this -- sort of use those words without thinking and don't give young people a full understanding of how these things we have called deficiencies are differences in the truest sense of the word.</p>
<p> You know, look at dyslexia.</p>
<p> You know, that's a difference.</p>
<p> It's got good things about it; it's got bad things about it.</p>
<p> You know, I don't write or read well.</p>
<p> That's something I'm not naive about, but there's a lot of research that shows that folks with dyslexia are more creative, more entrepreneurial than the general population.</p>
<p> Same goes with ADD and Asperger's and anxiety and depression.</p>
<p> These are very complex human phenomena.</p>
<p> And I had people in my life in my childhood and in particular during my transition to adulthood who helped me understand that and helped me understand that I am a part of a continuum of human difference, that diversity is a strength, that our culture, our schools, our workplaces need diversity in every single shape and form, and this is something to be proud of and not ashamed of.</p>
<p> That was an important lesson for me.</p>
<p> Second lesson.</p>
<p> Sounds simple, but hard to do.</p>
<p> I had to learn to ask for help and be okay getting help.</p>
<p> You know, during my early school challenges and struggles, I wasn't comfortable getting help even after I was diagnosed with a learning disability, even into my late adolescent, early adulthood, I had a hard time using accommodations -- books on tape, time extensions for exams.</p>
<p> And when I didn't use those accommodations, which were my right by law, I struggled and I failed.</p>
<p> And getting over that sense of shame, understanding that getting help is something everybody does.</p>
<p> Every human being, whether you have a disability or not, we are interdependent.</p>
<p> We lift each other up.</p>
<p> And that was an important thing for me to understand.</p>
<p> And, you know, I get more help now than I've ever done.</p>
<p> You know, I write books for a living.</p>
<p> You know, I spell at a third grade level.</p>
<p> How do I do that? Well, you know, I married my spellchecker.</p>
<p> You know, I [laughs], you know, and, you know, my wife, who was my girlfriend in college, would read papers I wrote, would read books to me.</p>
<p> My mom would spell check things.</p>
<p> You know, there's no shame in that.</p>
<p> And that also is something I continue into my professional life.</p>
<p> You know, getting help and getting accommodations isn't something that stops when school stops.</p>
<p> It's something we bring into the world of work.</p>
<p> It's something we bring into our interpersonal relationships.</p>
<p> It's a lifelong skill.</p>
<p> And I've mastered that skill and I wish I would have mastered that skill sooner.</p>
