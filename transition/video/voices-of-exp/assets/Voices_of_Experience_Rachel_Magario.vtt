&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Rachel Magario, and
I'm originally from Brazil,

00:00:14.876 --> 00:00:17.766 align:middle
but I've lived in the U.S. for 17 years.

00:00:18.236 --> 00:00:24.786 align:middle
I came here originally for college, and I
lost my sight when I was about six years old.

00:00:25.506 --> 00:00:30.806 align:middle
A lot of people think I can see some, but
really I cannot see anything other than light.

00:00:31.526 --> 00:00:34.276 align:middle
But that hasn't stopped me
from continuing my life.

00:00:35.196 --> 00:00:37.036 align:middle
That's my visible disability.

00:00:37.206 --> 00:00:39.556 align:middle
And then I have a couple of invisible ones.

00:00:40.776 --> 00:00:50.146 align:middle
When I was 20 years old and I was a freshman
in college I got run over by a car on campus,

00:00:50.256 --> 00:00:56.596 align:middle
and I broke two vertebras and had a head
concussion, several staples in my head.

00:00:56.946 --> 00:01:01.956 align:middle
And I also got a kidney failure due to that.

00:01:02.616 --> 00:01:07.046 align:middle
So I went to college doing
dialysis for about five years.

00:01:07.816 --> 00:01:10.276 align:middle
It took me seven years to finish college.

00:01:10.806 --> 00:01:12.886 align:middle
And I got two degrees.

00:01:13.836 --> 00:01:20.776 align:middle
And I also had to go through
some kidney transplant.

00:01:21.276 --> 00:01:25.456 align:middle
Today I work for the Simon
Technology Center at Pacer.

00:01:26.146 --> 00:01:34.096 align:middle
Pacer Center is an advocacy parent
agency, but we have several projects

00:01:34.596 --> 00:01:39.076 align:middle
and Simon Technology is only one of them.

00:01:39.346 --> 00:01:44.896 align:middle
So I'm an assistant technology -- I'm
an assistant technology specialist.

00:01:45.506 --> 00:01:53.036 align:middle
And what I do is try to help people
with their correct technology

00:01:53.066 --> 00:01:55.946 align:middle
to help them overcome a limitation.
