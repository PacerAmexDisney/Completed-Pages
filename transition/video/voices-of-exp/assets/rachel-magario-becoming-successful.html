<p>Well I think the major thing is attitude, the major component of being successful and overcoming difficulties is attitude.</p>
<p> Attitude is 60% of your battle.</p>
<p> If you can get up and look at a glass half full instead of half empty, then, you're on the right track.</p>
<p> What helped me was I have a very supportive mother.</p>
<p> My dad wasn't supportive but he also didn't stay in the way.</p>
<p> So, what happened was I was able to learn how to advocate for myself really early on.</p>
<p> My mother often forced teachers to have to discuss with me what would be our plan of action and not with her.</p>
<p> There was a time that she wasn't even available.</p>
<p> She would skip being in the picture to force teachers to work with me.</p>
<p> She taught me a lot of critical thinking and process at home so I could learn and detect what was needed for me to learn.</p>
<p> And then, just working with people, being able to explain to them that you have a problem and you might not know what that problem was.</p>
<p> And then, together, we can work it out.</p>
