&gt;&gt; Brandon Ziemke: Hi.

00:00:11.946 --> 00:00:13.246 align:middle
My name's Brandon Ziemke.

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:14.596 align:middle
I grew up in Virginia.

00:00:15.446 --> 00:00:18.566 align:middle
When I was 3 I moved to Seattle,
when I was 5 I moved here.

00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:22.486 align:middle
And, I pretty much knew I had a
disability since the day I was born.

00:00:23.646 --> 00:00:25.766 align:middle
School is pretty good some days, sometimes.

00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:31.486 align:middle
I think that Steve probably has been a big help.

00:00:31.486 --> 00:00:35.696 align:middle
I think overcoming obstacles sometimes.

00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:40.936 align:middle
I had to work on reading and
writing and using my muscles.

00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:44.296 align:middle
Like I didn't know how to ride
a bike until about 10 years ago.

00:00:44.296 --> 00:00:49.766 align:middle
I took it upon myself to learn
and it just came, came to me yeah.

00:00:50.846 --> 00:00:53.566 align:middle
Like I think I've been trying ever
since I was young to shoot a basket.

00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:59.606 align:middle
And, one day when I was in middle school I just
finally did five shots in a row, five baskets,

00:00:59.656 --> 00:01:04.126 align:middle
after a lot of misses and
trying and trying and trying.

00:01:04.126 --> 00:01:04.196 align:middle
Yeah.

00:01:04.196 --> 00:01:06.806 align:middle
I didn't want to be special needs people.

00:01:06.806 --> 00:01:10.546 align:middle
I wanted to be in the movies, I
wanted to be in the normal classes,

00:01:10.546 --> 00:01:14.576 align:middle
I wanted to be in [inaudible] with those people
because I felt like that was important to me.

00:01:14.576 --> 00:01:17.746 align:middle
Yes I have very high expectations of myself.

00:01:18.436 --> 00:01:21.776 align:middle
There were teachers, the people at my job now,

00:01:22.446 --> 00:01:25.706 align:middle
there are people at Kawasaki's,
there are people here on campus.

00:01:26.416 --> 00:01:28.386 align:middle
I mean the list just goes
on and on and on of people.

00:01:28.386 --> 00:01:33.146 align:middle
I have people here like [inaudible]
helped me learn to cook and clean

00:01:33.146 --> 00:01:37.476 align:middle
and do laundry and do math and stuff like that.

00:01:37.476 --> 00:01:37.626 align:middle
Yeah.

00:01:37.976 --> 00:01:44.096 align:middle
I do washing dishes, I do all sorts
of stuff in the kitchen around here.

00:01:44.496 --> 00:01:46.966 align:middle
And, it just kind of like community based.

00:01:46.966 --> 00:01:49.586 align:middle
You know, you have friends that
you can talk to and stuff at work.

00:01:50.816 --> 00:01:52.796 align:middle
I'm good at communicating.

00:01:53.576 --> 00:01:56.236 align:middle
I'm good at getting things
done as fast as possible.

00:01:57.936 --> 00:01:59.526 align:middle
There's always stuff to do.

00:02:00.296 --> 00:02:02.226 align:middle
There's never a boring moment at work.

00:02:03.216 --> 00:02:04.916 align:middle
Oh I feel really good about it.

00:02:05.686 --> 00:02:09.906 align:middle
And, I feel like I'm helping other people with
disabilities get better, because they're people

00:02:09.906 --> 00:02:14.116 align:middle
like me, that's why this is supposed to happen.

00:02:14.336 --> 00:02:14.596 align:middle
Yeah.

00:02:14.996 --> 00:02:16.596 align:middle
I really want to become an actor.

00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:19.686 align:middle
That's seriously something I'm
considering doing some day.

00:02:21.226 --> 00:02:25.366 align:middle
I've been in plays before
and I've done shows before.

00:02:26.226 --> 00:02:28.196 align:middle
And, I just want to someday
get that a little bit better.

00:02:28.916 --> 00:02:33.146 align:middle
My dream job would be V Productions in
Minneapolis that does Sesame Street Live.

00:02:33.326 --> 00:02:36.336 align:middle
I'd probably want to do like
marketing or something like that.

00:02:36.336 --> 00:02:40.416 align:middle
Like if you're doing a good job now,
don't give up because you're going

00:02:40.416 --> 00:02:42.966 align:middle
to get a job that you love someday.
