&gt;&gt; Dao Xiong: Well, my name's Dao Xiong, and
I'm a multi-cultural [inaudible] here working

00:00:17.616 --> 00:00:23.726 align:middle
with the Asian-American families of children
with disability here in the Minnesota.

00:00:24.776 --> 00:00:29.456 align:middle
I was originally from Laos, and I am parents

00:00:29.716 --> 00:00:34.786 align:middle
of seven children including a
daughter with [inaudible] disability.

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:48.816 align:middle
My daughter with [inaudible] disability has
an episode of high fever by the age of one,

00:00:50.076 --> 00:01:01.316 align:middle
and after that, she show some
significant delay in speech and physical.

00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:15.596 align:middle
So she spoke words by the age three
and walk by the age three and a half.

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:22.516 align:middle
During the time, I was young,
and I didn't know what to do,

00:01:23.636 --> 00:01:33.956 align:middle
but I learn a lot about her disability
by seeking psychological evaluation

00:01:33.956 --> 00:01:44.066 align:middle
and also [inaudible] evaluation,
and it was quite a challenge to do,

00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:50.916 align:middle
but I manage to do well as
being a young parents.

00:01:51.866 --> 00:02:00.606 align:middle
And it is not easy to do those thing,
but combine those resource together,

00:02:01.346 --> 00:02:08.756 align:middle
I feel more happier today
for what I did back then.

00:02:09.676 --> 00:02:17.866 align:middle
As parents, we all expect the
child to be healthy and bright

00:02:17.866 --> 00:02:21.546 align:middle
and be successful in school and in life.

00:02:22.486 --> 00:02:32.436 align:middle
So accepting her disability did
not just happen momentarily.

00:02:33.766 --> 00:02:39.866 align:middle
Once you saw some of the delay,
it did not happen that way.

00:02:40.836 --> 00:02:52.756 align:middle
I learn a lot about how she grew and how she
manage herself and how she function herself

00:02:53.566 --> 00:02:56.376 align:middle
in home and in the school setting.

00:02:57.416 --> 00:03:02.956 align:middle
So it is quite a challenge
to do all those thing.

00:03:04.586 --> 00:03:14.556 align:middle
What I, at the same time I expect all my seven
children to be successful in school, however,

00:03:14.826 --> 00:03:24.506 align:middle
for her, I understand that her life will
be limit because she has a disability.

00:03:25.806 --> 00:03:32.296 align:middle
But, however, I also have high
expectation of her to do well

00:03:32.296 --> 00:03:37.976 align:middle
in school based on her ability to learn.
