<p>Assistive technology is amazing and it plays until today a big part of my success.</p>
<p> I don't think I could be an Assistive Technology Specialist today without technology.</p>
<p> I wouldn't have been able to go through design school without technology or business school without technology.</p>
<p> My first piece of technology was a typewriter and it was key to help me do my homework and be able to communicate with other people when I didn't have anybody to transcribe braille for my teachers so that really sped the process.</p>
<p> Unfortunately, typewriters are now sophisticated and every time you made an error until I got the electric one that had the automatic eraser, didn't really work out.</p>
<p> I had to start all over again.</p>
<p> So computers are a big part of my life and I think I carry my Mac Air probably everywhere I go and my iPhone is definitely with me all the time, even when I'm asleep.</p>
<p> Assistive technology, especially with the phones today just with one tiny piece of technology I can take photos and figure out what I'm taking photos of and I can scan papers and have the text be converted for me to read.</p>
<p> I can scan barcodes and figure out what product I'm looking at and I can do color ID for colors.</p>
<p> It's not very great but at least it gives me an idea if it's dark or light colors.</p>
<p> Assistive technology has helped me connect to the world with Internet, with so many other people.</p>
<p> It has helped me to be a little--learn more about others and learn what others have done before me.</p>
<p> I think the Internet has done that for everybody but especially for me has given me another door and another tool in my toolbox so I can really connect with other people.</p>
