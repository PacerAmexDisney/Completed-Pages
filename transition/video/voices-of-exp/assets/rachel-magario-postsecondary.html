<p>I think the secret to success for post secondary is not knowing what career you're wanting to do.</p>
<p> It's knowing what you want to explore, because you only know what you want to do when you experience it.</p>
<p> I took all the opportunities I had in college.</p>
<p> Extracurricular activities give you experience, give you a glimpse on what to do and how to work.</p>
<p> It helps you build a work ethic.</p>
<p> Classes helps you to get the hard knowledge but it doesn't give you what they call sub skills, social skills.</p>
<p> So it's important to get involved with social clubs.</p>
<p> Then the other important part in college is you don't have an IP in a health support system, especially if you're in a big college.</p>
<p> I was in a 30,000 campus, 30,000 student campus.</p>
<p> And it's important to not let people discourage you on what you want to do.</p>
<p> It's important to finalize in your professors to figure out which classes will fit your learning style best and not be afraid to drop bottom that once they are not fitting your style.</p>
<p> And above all that, it's very important to be able to get internships, jobs and opportunities, before you get out of college because that is the time to experience in a safe way and learn.</p>
<p> So when you get outside of college, what they call the real world, you're able to find a job, but, more than that, find a path for your career; and college is the best place.</p>
<p> Don't be so worried about finishing early, like everybody else, but actually enjoying every opportunity that college can afford.</p>
