<p>Hi, I'm Rachel Magario, and I'm originally from Brazil, but I've lived in the U.S. for 17 years.</p>
<p> I came here originally for college, and I lost my sight when I was about six years old.</p>
<p> A lot of people think I can see some, but really I cannot see anything other than light.</p>
<p> But that hasn't stopped me from continuing my life.</p>
<p> That's my visible disability.</p>
<p> And then I have a couple of invisible ones.</p>
<p> When I was 20 years old and I was a freshman in college I got run over by a car on campus, and I broke two vertebras and had a head concussion, several staples in my head.</p>
<p> And I also got a kidney failure due to that.</p>
<p> So I went to college doing dialysis for about five years.</p>
<p> It took me seven years to finish college.</p>
<p> And I got two degrees.</p>
<p> And I also had to go through some kidney transplant.</p>
<p> Today I work for the Simon Technology Center at Pacer.</p>
<p> Pacer Center is an advocacy parent agency, but we have several projects and Simon Technology is only one of them.</p>
<p> So I'm an assistant technology -- I'm an assistant technology specialist.</p>
<p> And what I do is try to help people with their correct technology to help them overcome a limitation.</p>
