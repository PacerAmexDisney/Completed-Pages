&gt;&gt; Hassan Samantar: The transition
into adulthood.

00:00:13.796 --> 00:00:21.086 align:middle
Many times when I sit an IEP with the
parents, my job as the advocate is to explain

00:00:21.086 --> 00:00:28.796 align:middle
to the parents how the transition programs,
transition plans might be, can help them,

00:00:28.796 --> 00:00:34.496 align:middle
their kids to be more successful in the future.

00:00:34.886 --> 00:00:42.216 align:middle
I try to phrase it in a different way because
a transition might not be something that many

00:00:42.216 --> 00:00:47.846 align:middle
of our families are accustomed
to or familiar with.

00:00:48.486 --> 00:00:57.156 align:middle
I try to put the focus with, you know,
the benefits of a transition program

00:00:57.436 --> 00:01:02.906 align:middle
that the young adults, when they
post-secondary, how they can benefit.

00:01:03.356 --> 00:01:13.506 align:middle
How they can be successful in life and
be effective member of the community.

00:01:13.776 --> 00:01:17.056 align:middle
It, how it can lead to job opportunities.

00:01:17.056 --> 00:01:19.796 align:middle
They can learn in job skills.

00:01:20.186 --> 00:01:27.026 align:middle
I try to phrase it in a way
that culturally acceptable

00:01:27.346 --> 00:01:34.346 align:middle
and the parents can really understand what is
transition, what is it supposed to be doing

00:01:34.346 --> 00:01:41.986 align:middle
or meant to be doing, and how their kids can
benefit being a part of a transition program.

00:01:42.446 --> 00:01:51.746 align:middle
I would give the advice of understand
there might be a cultural component,

00:01:52.006 --> 00:01:55.596 align:middle
a component that might be
playing a role for the parents

00:01:55.896 --> 00:02:02.496 align:middle
if the parents are not really
open-minded to transition programs.

00:02:02.926 --> 00:02:07.656 align:middle
Understand there might be a cultural
component that's playing the role there.

00:02:07.716 --> 00:02:14.136 align:middle
Secondly, I would say try
to explain in a way that is,

00:02:14.536 --> 00:02:19.866 align:middle
it's a basic, in a way that it's a basic.

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:21.956 align:middle
What is the transition?

00:02:22.286 --> 00:02:24.636 align:middle
What is it supposed to do
before we jumped into it?

00:02:24.916 --> 00:02:29.116 align:middle
You know, more often as professionals,

00:02:29.116 --> 00:02:35.726 align:middle
we assume parents really understand
the services that we're providing.

00:02:36.146 --> 00:02:38.056 align:middle
So don't just assume.

00:02:38.376 --> 00:02:45.476 align:middle
If there is an interpreter, there's a
language barrier, utilize your interpreter.

00:02:45.906 --> 00:02:52.696 align:middle
Have the interpreter really explain what
the transition meant and how it, you know,

00:02:52.696 --> 00:02:55.126 align:middle
their kids can benefit in the future.

00:02:55.536 --> 00:03:02.516 align:middle
So more emphasis on that way than the
services themselves or the transition itself.

00:03:02.946 --> 00:03:11.486 align:middle
Once the parents are convinced and understand
that their children can benefit this program,

00:03:11.736 --> 00:03:19.726 align:middle
they're more likely to accept the
transition services and be a participant.

00:03:19.726 --> 00:03:26.736 align:middle
And that probably would be the best thing
that I can contribute to in advising

00:03:26.736 --> 00:03:31.396 align:middle
to the educators or professionals.
