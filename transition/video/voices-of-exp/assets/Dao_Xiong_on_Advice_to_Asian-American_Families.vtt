00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.156 align:middle
&gt;&gt; Success story.

00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:23.056 align:middle
&gt;&gt; Well, she's in a program right now and
the program itself focus more on job skill

00:00:23.776 --> 00:00:34.836 align:middle
and because she love children and she is
doing any typical like assembly paying

00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:41.036 align:middle
or you know drawing thing or [inaudible] mail

00:00:42.186 --> 00:00:48.656 align:middle
and she love those things
that relate to children.

00:00:49.536 --> 00:01:00.526 align:middle
And earning money has inspired to do those
things she love to do that and have money

00:01:00.526 --> 00:01:08.066 align:middle
and spend time in the community, spend
time shopping and she love shopping.

00:01:08.606 --> 00:01:19.126 align:middle
And the program she also have time to
go to the pond, go to the community

00:01:19.526 --> 00:01:22.086 align:middle
to do some recreation and leisure.

00:01:22.606 --> 00:01:31.816 align:middle
So this is the thing that she's doing
today and she enjoys so much and she love

00:01:31.816 --> 00:01:34.646 align:middle
to do those and she's very happy.

00:01:34.646 --> 00:01:35.906 align:middle
And the same here.

00:01:36.336 --> 00:01:44.476 align:middle
We are very happy that she has a place to go,
has something to do to earn money for herself

00:01:45.016 --> 00:01:49.976 align:middle
and we also take her to the community --

00:01:50.286 --> 00:01:55.786 align:middle
our owned community like to
shop and she like shopping.

00:01:57.226 --> 00:01:58.196 align:middle
First thing first.

00:01:58.196 --> 00:02:03.426 align:middle
I believe parents are the expert
of what skill your child need

00:02:03.426 --> 00:02:06.566 align:middle
in order to be successful in life.

00:02:07.406 --> 00:02:14.276 align:middle
And I strongly parents to focus
those skill early as possible.

00:02:15.356 --> 00:02:23.556 align:middle
The other thing to have your child explore
job opportunities in the community to see

00:02:23.556 --> 00:02:36.996 align:middle
if anything that your child would like and want,
what skill that is required to do those job.

00:02:37.636 --> 00:02:41.766 align:middle
So learning that firsthand.

00:02:42.016 --> 00:02:49.226 align:middle
For some children with disability it will
take longer time to learn those skill

00:02:49.626 --> 00:02:54.096 align:middle
and it take time for them
to be familiar with the job

00:02:54.096 --> 00:02:58.666 align:middle
or the skill that they can use effectively.

00:02:59.616 --> 00:03:06.376 align:middle
The other thing too I think not only focus
job because independent living skills

00:03:06.966 --> 00:03:13.686 align:middle
and it doesn't matter if your child live
with you in the future or in a group home

00:03:13.686 --> 00:03:21.626 align:middle
or live independently, the independent
living skill is very important.

00:03:22.066 --> 00:03:29.296 align:middle
Like learn how to call 9-1-1
when there is an emergency.

00:03:30.206 --> 00:03:36.146 align:middle
You know my daughter had to learn those skills
whether she in the program or she's home

00:03:36.656 --> 00:03:42.566 align:middle
because this is a skill that she
would need no matter where she live.

00:03:42.566 --> 00:03:47.226 align:middle
The other thing too I think for --

00:03:47.526 --> 00:03:57.326 align:middle
I think parents including me we need
to participate in the transition.

00:03:57.876 --> 00:04:07.496 align:middle
More meaningfully to work with schools, with
the program, to provide more effective skill

00:04:07.496 --> 00:04:16.076 align:middle
that our children will learn
to be successful at the school.

00:04:16.996 --> 00:04:24.586 align:middle
So I believe that your ideas,
your input, and your knowledge

00:04:24.586 --> 00:04:30.116 align:middle
of your child is very important
for your child's future life.
