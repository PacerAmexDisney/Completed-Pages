<p>I was asked to share three things that could address young children's challenging behavior.</p>
<p> So number one, the best path to resolving a child's challenging behavior is first you have to understand it.</p>
<p> So we have to figure out what the purpose is and what the function is.</p>
<p> And you pretty much need to say that out loud, so you need to say, this child is engaging in this behavior to gain attention or this child is trying to escape an activity.</p>
<p> Once you're able to say it out loud you'll be so much better able to develop a plan.</p>
<p> My second tip is that our posture has to be one of understanding and instruction, so from an understanding perspective what you want to make sure is that you know what the behavior's about, why the child is doing it.</p>
<p> So for example a posture of understanding might be oh the child's having a tantrum because he wants to get out of an activity.</p>
<p> And then a position of instruction is, well if he's going to fall on the floor and have a big fat tantrum to get out of an activity what can I teach him, how can I teach him how to request getting out of the activity in a way that's more appropriate and socially acceptable? That's my second tip.</p>
<p> My third tip is, in terms of resolving behavior our best approach is to prevent it.</p>
<p> Once a child has a meltdown and has behavior challenges there is not a lot we can do, they're already in the behavior and all we can do then is make sure that we don't pay off the behavior.</p>
<p> But in order to really address the behavior let's prevent it from occurring in the first place.</p>
<p> And so prevention strategies might be things like, giving children a first then contingency, first you do something that's hard for you and then you can do something that you like.</p>
<p> Preparing a child for what the expectations of the environment or the activity will be.</p>
<p> You might prepare a child using your instructions, you might prepare a child using visuals, you might write a social story that describes what's going to happen, what the child might feel, and what are the appropriate behaviors in that context.</p>
<p> So by thinking about let's just prevent behavior from occurring in the first place the child's less likely to have behavior, and meanwhile we can begin to teach them new social skills and appropriate behaviors to use.</p>
