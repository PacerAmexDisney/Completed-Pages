00:00:05.376 --> 00:00:08.376
>> Will you be ready when it's
time for your son or daughter

2
00:00:08.376 --> 00:00:10.876
with a disability to move
to a place of their own?

3
00:00:11.346 --> 00:00:13.386
The time to start planning is now.

4
00:00:14.176 --> 00:00:18.086
Hi, my name is Susan Shimota, and I'm
the housing project coordinator here

5
00:00:18.086 --> 00:00:18.936
at PACER center.

6
00:00:19.776 --> 00:00:24.706
PACER is a Minnesota nonprofit
organization and a national parent center

7
00:00:25.136 --> 00:00:29.706
that provides information, training,
and assistance to parents of children

8
00:00:29.816 --> 00:00:32.006
and young adults with all disabilities.

9
00:00:32.826 --> 00:00:38.466
I have a 25-year-old son with autism spectrum
disorder and a mental health disability.

10
00:00:39.596 --> 00:00:43.116
If you have a child with a
disability who is 14 or older,

11
00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:46.186
it's important to start thinking
about housing now.

12
00:00:47.116 --> 00:00:52.436
I'd like to talk to you for a few minutes about
two housing-related points you need to know.

13
00:00:53.496 --> 00:00:57.596
First, why is it important to
start thinking about housing now?

14
00:00:58.586 --> 00:01:02.016
And second, what is person-centered
thinking and planning?

15
00:01:03.506 --> 00:01:06.976
First, why is it important to
start thinking about housing now?

16
00:01:07.946 --> 00:01:11.596
Most parents expect their kids to
grow up and move out of the house.

17
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:16.986
For parents of children with disabilities,
the young adult's transition into a place

18
00:01:16.986 --> 00:01:20.086
of their own usually takes
more thinking and planning.

19
00:01:21.146 --> 00:01:25.686
We recognize that every child has
different abilities and needs for support

20
00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:29.506
and that most parents have to
be involved in that process.

21
00:01:30.676 --> 00:01:35.836
We also believe that starting early will lead
to better outcomes for your son or daughter.

22
00:01:36.836 --> 00:01:41.906
This leads me to my second point; what
is person-centered thinking and planning?

23
00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:45.756
One of the first steps in
person-centered thinking,

24
00:01:45.896 --> 00:01:50.626
which starts before person-centered
planning, is to consider where your son

25
00:01:50.626 --> 00:01:53.126
or daughter might want to live on their own.

26
00:01:54.106 --> 00:01:58.576
For example, you might think your daughter
would like to have a roommate and live

27
00:01:58.576 --> 00:02:01.776
within walking distance of a library and a park.

28
00:02:03.026 --> 00:02:07.956
Notice that I didn't ask you what type of
housing you want your daughter to live in,

29
00:02:08.506 --> 00:02:13.006
but rather what type of housing you
think she would want to live in.

30
00:02:13.786 --> 00:02:15.426
This is person-centered thinking.

31
00:02:16.716 --> 00:02:19.786
Then you might want to have a
casual conversation with your son

32
00:02:19.786 --> 00:02:21.616
or daughter and ask the same question.

33
00:02:22.286 --> 00:02:26.146
When you grow up, where do you think
you would like to live and work?

34
00:02:27.446 --> 00:02:32.146
Talk to them about the places they like
to go, the activities they like to do,

35
00:02:32.666 --> 00:02:34.246
and the people they like to be with.

36
00:02:35.446 --> 00:02:38.316
These questions encourage
person-centered thinking.

37
00:02:39.596 --> 00:02:45.476
I'd suggest that you revisit that subject with
your son or daughter on multiple occasions

38
00:02:45.546 --> 00:02:48.516
and you could also have discussions
with relatives and friends

39
00:02:49.356 --> 00:02:52.126
if they are not able to actively participate.

40
00:02:54.406 --> 00:02:59.096
The important thing is now to shift your
thinking and put your son or daughter

41
00:02:59.166 --> 00:03:03.816
in the driver's seat, so that they are
at the center of the planning process.

42
00:03:04.716 --> 00:03:07.496
That's where the term person-centered
planning comes from.

43
00:03:09.166 --> 00:03:15.176
Person-centered planning is a process that
is driven by the unique likes and dislikes

44
00:03:15.246 --> 00:03:17.786
of the person and his or her family.

45
00:03:18.816 --> 00:03:21.566
What are your son or daughter's
unique hopes and dreams?

46
00:03:22.506 --> 00:03:24.446
What is important to him or her?

47
00:03:25.896 --> 00:03:31.326
I had a parent tell me recently that her son was
determined to live downtown so it was convenient

48
00:03:31.366 --> 00:03:32.806
for him to attend sporting events.

49
00:03:34.136 --> 00:03:38.316
Although the parents were concerned
about safety and supports downtown,

50
00:03:38.876 --> 00:03:41.336
they were exploring the possibilities for him.

51
00:03:43.496 --> 00:03:47.556
I also spoke to a young adult
named Joe, who told me that he

52
00:03:47.556 --> 00:03:50.516
and his friend Steve wanted
to rent an apartment together.

53
00:03:51.686 --> 00:03:55.886
One of the most important things to
them was being near a coffee shop.

54
00:03:56.836 --> 00:04:00.196
This might not be at the top of
your list or mind, but for Joe

55
00:04:00.196 --> 00:04:04.646
and Steve this was important
and that is what really matters.

56
00:04:06.076 --> 00:04:10.486
Not only is this person-centered
approach a more positive way to plan

57
00:04:10.556 --> 00:04:14.606
for your young adult's future,
it is also supported by law.

58
00:04:16.196 --> 00:04:19.796
So to recap, when thinking about
housing for your son or daughter,

59
00:04:20.286 --> 00:04:24.366
first start the conversation now and second,

60
00:04:25.266 --> 00:04:29.346
ask questions that encourage person-centered
thinking with your son or daughter.

61
00:04:30.446 --> 00:04:35.616
It is an exciting time and we encourage you to
move forward with these important first steps.

62
00:04:36.396 --> 00:04:46.986
