    <h1>The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and Secondary Transition</h1>
    
<p>The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is the federal special education law that ensures all children with disabilities have access to a free, appropriate public education. The IDEA recognizes the importance of preparing youth for success after high school and states that transition planning for students who receive special education services and have an Individualized Education Program (IEP) must begin by age 16 <em>(some states require that the process starts earlier</em>). Transition planning means evaluating needs, strengths, and skills required for a student to move from high school to postsecondary life.</p>
<p>As a parent of a youth with disabilities, understanding the transition planning requirements in IDEA can help you work with your child's IEP team to plan appropriate transition goals and services. Below you can read the sections of IDEA regulations that specifically relate to transition and find other helpful guidance on IDEA transition requirements.</p>
<p><a href="http://idea.ed.gov/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cregs%2C" target="_blank">IDEA (34 CFR§300) regulations <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> provide language in six sections that specifically refer to transition. The following sections of IDEA cover important transition topics such as when to begin including transition goals and objectives in the IEP; transition services; IEP team composition; transfer of rights at age of majority; and requirements for exiting high school programs.</p>
