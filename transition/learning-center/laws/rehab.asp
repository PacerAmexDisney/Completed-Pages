<p>The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 is the foundation of all the later disability-related legislation and was a milestone for individuals with disabilities across the nation. Sometimes it is called &ldquo;The Rehab Act.&rdquo; This federal law prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in federally funded programs and authorizes state vocational rehabilitation (VR) programs, client assistance programs, and independent living centers. Sections of this law are often referred to by their Title or Section number, e.g., Section 504 or Title I. </p>

<h3>Definition of disability</h3>
<p>Under the Rehabilitation Act, an individual with a disability is defined as a person who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. </p>
<p>Major life activities include walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, working, caring for oneself, and performing manual tasks. The Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008 clarified that the definition of disability was meant to be interpreted broadly and expanded the list of life activities to include reading, concentrating, standing, lifting, bending and others.</p>

  <table class="qatable" border="0" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td><p><strong>State Vocational Rehabilitation   programs</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>State   Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) programs provide services that enable   individuals with disabilities to pursue meaningful employment that   corresponds with an individual&rsquo;s abilities and interests. Some states have   separate vocational rehabilitation programs for individuals who are blind or   visually impaired, and a few states have separate programs for individuals   who are deaf or hard of hearing. VR services are provided to eligible   individuals with disabilities through the local offices of state VR agencies   and through community-based organizations under contract to state agencies. There   is no age requirement under the vocational rehabilitation program, though   normally youth need to be ready to prepare for employment. </p>
      <p>The   Rehab Act also funds <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/programs/vramerind/index.html?exp=0" target="_blank">Vocational Rehabilitation   Services Projects for American Indians with Disabilities <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>, known as &quot;121   Projects&quot; (named for the Section of the law where the program is   listed).</p></td>

    <td><p><strong>Eligibility for state vocational   rehabilitation programs</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>To be   eligible for VR services, an individual must:</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>have        a physical or mental impairment that results in a substantial impediment        to employment </li>
        <li>be        able to benefit from receiving VR services </li>
        <li>require        VR services to <em>prepare for</em>, <em>secure</em>, <em>retain</em> or <em>regain</em> employment.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Services   available through VR programs vary depending upon the state. Services must be   related to the employment goal and can include:</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>vocational        evaluation</li>
        <li>counseling        and guidance</li>
      </ul>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>job        search and placement </li>
      </ul></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><strong>Individual Plan for Employment   (IPE)</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>VR counselors first assess an individual's eligibility   for VR services. When a young person is eligible to receive VR services, a   counselor is assigned to work with him or her. Together, the young adult and   his or her counselor will develop an Individual Plan for Employment (IPE)   that identifies needed VR services. Family members and advocates can   participate in this process, although youth who have reached their state's   legal age of adulthood must give their written permission for others to be   involved.</p>
    <p>Similar to an Individualized Education Program (IEP),   the IPE will have a description of an employment goal, a timeline to achieve   the goal, and a description of the services and service providers needed. One   of the main differences in the IPE from the IEP is that IPE focuses on   employment goals. It is not a continuation of special education services as   defined under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.</p></td>
