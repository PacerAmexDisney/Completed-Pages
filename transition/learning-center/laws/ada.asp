    <h1><strong>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990</strong></h1>
    
<p>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is the most comprehensive federal civil rights statute protecting the rights of people with disabilities. It affects access to employment; state and local government programs and services; access to places of public accommodation such as businesses, transportation, and nonprofit service providers; and telecommunications.</p>
<h2>Definition of Disability</h2>
  <p>The ADA protects the civil rights of individuals who (1) have a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, (2) have a record of such an impairment, or (3) are regarded as having such an impairment. Major life activities include walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, working, caring for oneself, and performing manual tasks. </p>
<p>The Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008 clarified that the definition of disability was meant to be interpreted broadly and expanded the list of life activities to include reading, concentrating, standing, lifting, bending and others. The amendments also made it clear that the term &ldquo;substantially limits&rdquo; must be interpreted broadly. Disabilities such as depression, diabetes, asthma or anxiety, or digestive disorders with symptoms that are episodic or in remission must be considered as if they are active. They must also be considered even if a person uses &ldquo;mitigating measures,&rdquo; such as medication or assistive technology, that lessen the impact of a person&rsquo;s disability.</p>

<table class="qatable" border="0" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td><p><em>What are civil rights protections for people with disabilities in employment under the ADA and what is required from employers?</em></p></td>
    <td><p>Title I of the ADA applies to employers with 15 or more employees. It prohibits discrimination in recruitment, hiring, promotions, training, pay, social activities, and other privileges of employment. It restricts questions that can be asked about an applicant's disability before a job offer is made. It also requires that employers provide &ldquo;reasonable accommodations&rdquo; to the known physical or mental limitations of otherwise qualified individuals with disabilities, unless it results in undue hardship.</p></td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td><p><em>What is a &ldquo;reasonable accommodation?&rdquo;</em></p></td>
    <td><p>&ldquo;Reasonable accommodations&rdquo; are any modification to a job or the work environment that will enable a qualified applicant or employee with a disability to participate in the application process or to perform essential job functions. Examples of job accommodations include reassigning nonessential job responsibilities, changing the layout of workstations, or modifying equipment. Although more than half of all accommodations cost nothing, tax incentives are available to help employers implement workplace accommodations.</p></td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
  <td><p><em>What are the limits of ADA in employment?</em></p></td>
  <td><p>It is important for youth and families to understand that while the ADA protects employees from being discriminated against on the basis of disability, it does not require employers to hire an applicant with a disability if there is another applicant who is more qualified or just as qualified. Nor does the ADA protect employees with disabilities from being fired or laid off. As long as a dismissal is not based on an employee&rsquo;s disability, employers are not violating the ADA</p></td>
