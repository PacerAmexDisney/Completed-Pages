  <p>Many of today&rsquo;s emerging careers require skills that can only be obtained through postsecondary education. Families of youth with disabilities across the spectrum need to prepare their youth to be successful in postsecondary education as adult learners. As parents of a son or daughter with a disability, it&rsquo;s important to communicate the value of postsecondary education and encourage their son or daughter to consider a variety of available options. In order to communicate the importance of the high expectation that postsecondary education is an achievable goal, parents need to be informed about successful strategies, resources, and tips they can use to prepare their youth to attain their dreams of meaningful employment and a lifetime of learning. </p>

  <p>Workshop materials were developed by PACER Center, a national Parent Center based in Minnesota, in collaboration with the Iowa State Department of Education under the Iowa Personnel Development Grant, a grant from the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP). For more information about this workshop, contact Sean Roy at PACER Center (952) 838-9000.</p>

  <h3><strong><img class="fltrt" src="/transition/learning-center/postsecondary/images/getting-and-keeping-the-first-job.jpg" width="294" height="186" alt=""/>Getting and Keeping the First Job</strong></h3>
  <p>Writing a resume, being interviewed, identifying job accommodations if necessary, and deciding whether or not to disclose a disability to an employer may seem like daunting tasks to some families and youth. The importance of work and real life experiences of youth with disabilities as they attempt to enter the job market is emphasized along with the roles of self-advocacy, career planning, and how families can be involved in the process.  Descriptions of the possible concerns in the employment process as well as suggestions for increasing the likelihood of being hired are discussed. The workshop ends with a discussion about self-employment as an option for youth with disabilities, and some additional advice for families to consider is a workshop designed to help families understand the realities of employment for all youth, with a special emphasis on strategies youth with disabilities can use to improve employment prospects.</p>

  <p>Workshop materials were developed by PACER Center, a national Parent Center based in Minnesota, in collaboration with the Administration on Developmental Disabilities (ADD) under the National Family Advocacy Support and Training (FAST) Project.

  <h3><strong>Project Launch: Connecting Youth to Communities, College and Careers</strong></h3>
  <p>Through live streaming and workshops, Project Launch provides parents, youth, and professionals with information on mastering the &ldquo;basics,&rdquo; leveraging technology to improve executive function skills, and planning for life after high school. Designed to improve independent living, postsecondary education, and employment for transition-age youth with disabilities the goal is to increase the amount and quality of participation of transition age youth, their family members, educators and advocates in services provided under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Information about postsecondary education, career exploration, independent living, person-centered planning, informed choice, technology, and collaborative parent-professional partnerships are some of the topics covered by Project Launch workshops. A new series of community-based &ldquo;Workshops Without Walls&rdquo; is offered in diverse and rural communities to increase knowledge and participation with the Department of Vocational Rehabilitation staff, workforce centers, and other adult disability services.</p>

  <h3><strong>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Series</strong></h3>
  <p>PACER Center provides parent training and workshops on preparing youth for the transition to postsecondary education, as well as guidance on the changing nature of the parent role in postsecondary education.</p>
  <p>PACER&rsquo;s <a href="/transition/resource-library/publications/NPC-42.pdf" target="_blank">FAQ on Postsecondary Education and the ADA and 504</a> is one of the most downloaded documents and is reprinted widely throughout the U.S. Both the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 are civil rights laws that protect individuals with disabilities from discrimination. However, the Rehabilitation Act also goes beyond providing legal protections. It provides for direct services to people with disabilities which help them to become qualified for employment. Knowledge of how the two laws work together -- where one leaves off and another steps in-- can help individuals with disabilities prepare for success in the workforce and advocate for their rights in society. <a href="/transition/resource-library/#ADAarticles">PACER&rsquo;s series on ADA</a> and how it impacts those with and without disabilities provides a comprehensive overview of ADA and postsecondary education, Section 504, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Transition, Health Care Providers, and the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). The ADA is a promise of opportunity for education, employment, transportation, and inclusion, but a promise without action is hollow. &ldquo;That is where rehabilitation comes in to go hand in glove with the ADA to take advantage of all that promise,&quot; said Senator Tom Harkin.</p>
