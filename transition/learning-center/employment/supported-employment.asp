<h3>Supported Employment is for persons</h3>
<ul>
	<li>with the most significant disabilities, </li>
    <li>who need intensive or ongoing job support, </li>
    <li>who have traditionally been excluded from competitive work settings, or </li>
    <li>whose work has been interrupted or intermittent because of their disabilities. </li>
</ul>
<p>Supported employment is based on the principle that individuals with severe disabilities have the right to be employed by community businesses where they can earn comparable wages, work side-by-side with co-workers with or without disabilities, and experience all of the same benefits as other employees of the company. This idea is often referred to as &ldquo;Employment First.&rdquo; Supported employment assists people with severe disabilities by providing individualized supports that enable them to choose the kind of job they want and to become successful members of the workforce.</p>
  <p>Accessing supported employment services may vary by state, but the typical path is either through county Developmental Disabilities programs or through federally-funded Vocational Rehabilitation agencies (possibly referred to as VR, DVR, or DRS in your state). Some states have separate Vocational Rehabilitation agencies for persons who are blind.</p>
  <p>Organizations that deliver supported employment services include Day Training and Habilitation agencies (DT&amp;H), Community Rehabilitation Programs (CRP), and Community Support Programs (CSP). Parents are strongly encouraged to gather as much information as possible about agencies that offer employment support for persons with disabilities to insure a good fit.Â  </p>
