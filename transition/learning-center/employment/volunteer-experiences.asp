On the Home Front</a></em><br />
This Parent Brief describes ways in which youth and families can help youth effectively explore work-based learning outside of school settings.	</p></div>

<p>
The value of involving students with and without disabilities in volunteer and community service activities has received increasing attention in recent years. Participation in volunteer activities has been linked to increased engagement in democratic processes, lowered likelihood of dropping out, improved transition from school to work, and improved educational attitudes and performance. 
</p>
<p>
Typically, youth with disabilities have been seen as the recipients of philanthropic services rather than as providers of such services themselves. However, voluntary service, community service, and service learning offer many possibilities for youth with disabilities. They can contribute to their communities and experience the resulting benefits -- opportunities to learn, work experience, a sense of belonging, and respect. Such service also promotes full participation of people with disabilities in society. 
</p>
<p>
Students get a chance to apply academic skills to a work or volunteer setting and develop relevant soft skills such as teamwork and time management. Getting involved in meaningful activities outside the classroom helps students feel more committed to their education, making them more likely to stay in school. l In addition to exploring potential careers, students develop networks that can help them find employment. Students with disabilities have an opportunity to assess the impact of their disability in employment or volunteer settings and consider issues such as disclosure of a disability and job accommodations.
