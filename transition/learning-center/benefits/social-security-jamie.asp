<em><a href="/transition/resource-library/publications/NPC-25.pdf" target="_blank">The Supplemental Security Income Application Process</a> <i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o"></i></em>
</p>
	</div>-->


    <p>If you receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), you will automatically be eligible for Vocational Rehabilitation unless your disability is so severe that you won&rsquo;t benefit. The Rehabilitation Act assumes that people can work, no matter how significant their disability might be. If the agency does not believe you can work, it must prove its case with &ldquo;clear and convincing&rdquo; evidence.</p>
    <h2 class="greenBar">SSI Eligibility</h2>
    <p>SSI requiring a significant physical and/or mental impairment and also has limits on income and resources. More information on the SSI benefits and the application process can be found in the <a href="/transition/resource-library/publications/bridge-to-work-trainers-manual.pdf">Bridge to Work <i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> handout. </p>
    <h3>Definition of Disability</h3>
    <p>You must not be able to engage in any substantial gainful activity (SGA) because of a medically-determinable physical or mental impairments(s) that is expected to result in death, or that has lasted or is expected to last for a continuous period of at least 12 months. </p>
    <p><strong>Substantial Gainful Activity (SGA)</strong><br />
    SGA: Work is &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; if it involves doing significant physical or mental activities or a combination of both. For work activity to be substantial, it does not need to be performed on a full-time basis.</p>
    <p>Gainful work activity means:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Work performed for pay or profit, or</li>
      <li>Work of a nature generally performed for pay or profit; or</li>
      <li>Work intended for profit, whether or not a profit is realized. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Income Limitation</h3>
    <p>The monthly income limitation of $1,130 (2016) is required for program eligibility but can be exceeded once on the program. Benefits will be reduced as income rises, but SSI and other program eligibility such as Medicaid will continue.</p>
    <h3>Resource Limitation</h3>
    <p>Resource limitation is $2,000 (2016) and includes all cash, stocks, bonds, bank accounts, and real estate in the recipient&rsquo;s name as a resource. SSI doesn&rsquo;t count some assets, such as a house, vehicle, household goods, personal items, or grants for education.</p>
    <p>If the resource limitation is exceeded for even one day during a month, the SSI cash benefit might be suspended for that month. This might occur if a checking account balance in the recipient&rsquo;s name is over the $2,000 limit while waiting for rent or utility payments to be processed. It is important to be careful of the ongoing balance or the SSI benefit for that month may be cancelled or repayment of that month&rsquo;s benefit required at a later date.  </p>
    
    <h2 class="greenBar">SSI Resource Exceptions</h2>
    <p><a href="https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0500830455" target="_blank">A Social Security Administration policy <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>provides exceptions to the SSI resource limit if you are a student receiving a grant, scholarship, fellowship, or gift used for paying tuition, fees, or other necessary educational expenses at a college or vocational school.  Depending upon the type of aid this exclusion might be for a 9 month period of time or unlimited amount of time.</p>
    <h3>Policy Highlights</h3>
    <p><strong>Unlimited Amount of Time</strong><br />
    The SSA will exclude all financial aid that you get from either Title IV Higher Education Act or BIA assistance when it calculates your income and resources. There is no time limit for how long the SSA will exclude the assistance, no matter how long you keep the funds. It also doesn&rsquo;t matter how you spend the money you receive from this type of financial aid.</p>
    <p>Examples include:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Title IV assistance under the Higher Education Act (HEA)</li>
        <li>Pell grants</li>
        <li>State Student Incentives</li>
        <li>Academic Achievement Incentive Scholarships</li>
        <li>Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunities Grants (FSEOG)</li>
        <li>Federal Educational Loans (like Federal PLUS Loans, Perkins Loans, Stafford Loans, Ford Loans) and</li>
        <li>Work-Study Programs.</li>
      <li>Assistance under the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Other Funding Sources</strong><br />
    Most other financial assistance used to pay school-related fees will be disregarded from your resources calculation for a period of nine-months, beginning with the month&nbsp;<em>after&nbsp;</em>you receive the money. This includes grants from the government or private sources, scholarships, gifts, and fellowships.</p>
    <p>Grants, scholarships, and fellowships can be paid by nonprofit organizations, federal, state, or local governments, or private businesses.</p>
    <p>Gifts must be used to pay for school-related fees. In order to qualify as an educational gift, the money must be given to you without any expectation that it will be paid back. It also can&rsquo;t be given to you based on some legal obligation on the part of the giver—such as part of a child support order. The giver must give up complete control of the money. When a parent pays for college, it counts as a gift.</p>
    <p><strong>Use of Funds</strong><br />
    These funds &ndash; gift, grant, fellowship, and scholarship money &ndash; must be used to pay tuition or school-related fees to be excluded. School-related fees include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lab fees</li>
      <li>Fees for student activities</li>
      <li>Transportation costs</li>
      <li>Supplies like paper, pens, and notebooks</li>
      <li>Technology fees</li>
      <li>Text books, and</li>
      <li>Impairment-related expenses needed for you to go to school      (such as transportation).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you use any of the grant, scholarship, or gift money for expenses other than necessary educational-related expenses&nbsp;<em>or&nbsp;</em>you don&rsquo;t intend to use it to pay for necessary educational-related expenses, the money will be counted as income.</p>
    <p>Be aware that even funds set aside for (or already spent) specifically for your food and shelter are&nbsp;<em><strong>not</strong></em>&nbsp;entitled to any exclusion, and will be counted as a resource.</p>
    <p>If you have grant, scholarship, fellowship, or gift money left over at the end of the nine-month exclusion period, it will be counted against you as a resource during the first month&nbsp;<em>after&nbsp;</em>the nine-month exclusion period has ended. So be certain to use all the funds available to you in a timely manner. If funds are counted as part of your resource you may become ineligible for your SSI benefits until it is used. If you find funds will be left over consider setting up a Plan to Achieve Self-Support (PASS) for an additional employment related goal. </p>
    
    <h2 class="greenBar">The Ticket to Work Program</h2>
    <p> Ticket to Work is a program, not a physical ticket, for individuals with disabilities on Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Social Security Disability Income (SSDI). The main purpose of the program is to help and encourage recipients to train for, return to, or begin to work. It is free and voluntary service. The <em>&ldquo;Ticket&rdquo;</em> expands vocational services&nbsp;and provides additional protections to their current benefits when they return to work or try an employment or accommodation option. All work incentives are allowed with the ticket. The main advantage for individuals with disabilities is the wider selection of employment programs offered at the Ticket to Work Employment Networks (ENs). </p>
    <p>Many disability recipients, parents, or guardians believe that using the <em>&ldquo;Ticket</em>&rdquo; might risk future eligibility for benefits. Although the&nbsp;expedited reinstatement rules are meant to reassure recipients and families of continued eligibility if work trials fail and the individual remains disabled by SSA&rsquo;s criteria, their definition of disability and the extensive application process may cause unwarranted fears of employment. More information on the &ldquo;Ticket Program&rdquo; and ENs can be found on the Social Security Administration <a href="http://www.socialsecruity.gov/work" target="_blank">Welcome to the Work Site <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> or by calling 1-866-YOURTICKET or for TTY -866-833-2967. </p>
    
    <h2 class="greenBar">Participation in Vocational Rehabilitation and Section 301</h2>
    <p>Participating in VR is your choice, but if you have an Individualized Plan for Employment (IPE) and are making progress towards your program objectives, under <a href="https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0414505010" target="_blank">Section 301 <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> (Social Security Disability Amendments of 1980) your SSI eligibility status will not be reviewed based on the&nbsp;<em>medical&nbsp;</em>requirements for disability. These reviews are usually conducted yearly or less frequently depending upon the disability. All Social Security agents are not aware of this rule so be sure to mention it along with any other work incentive you are using. The income you make may still affect your eligibility or benefit amount.&nbsp;Refer to SSI Income and Resource Limitations to make certain you stay within SSI&rsquo;s requirements. </p>
    <p>To qualify for SSI continued payments under Section 301:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You must be participating in an appropriate program of VR or similar services that began before your eligibility ends; and</li>
      <li>Social Security&rsquo;s review of the program must show that your participation will likely result in a decrease in future SSI benefits. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Examples of appropriate programs include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A VR agency using an individualized plan for employment (IPE),</li>
      <li>A program carried out under an individual work plan (IWP) with an employment network (EN) under the Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency Program,&nbsp; </li>
      <li>An individualized education program (IEP) for a youth who is age 18 through 21,</li>
      <li>Support services using an individualized written employment plan,</li>
      <li>A written service plan with a school under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act,</li>
      <li>The Ticket to Work; or </li>
      <li>A Plan to Achieve Self-Support (PASS). </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="greenBar">Social Security&rsquo;s SSI Work Incentives</h2>
    <p>Work Incentives allows recipients to keep all or part of their benefits while exploring employment. Cash benefits and Medicaid or Medicare often continue throughout this transition to work. If the recipient begins working but then discovers he or she is unable to continue to work due to disability expedited reinstatement rules are in place to allow return to full benefits. In fact, Social Security must prove that the individual has medically improved and is no longer eligible by their criteria to deny reinstatement and for up to 6 months while re-evaluating eligibility benefits will be reinstated. </p>
    <p>The Social Security Administration provides <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/disabilityresearch/wi/generalinfo.htm" target="_blank">information on work incentives <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> for both SSI and SSDI.  A few helpful work incentives for SSI recipients are listed below. </p>
    <h3>Expedited Reinstatement (EXR)</h3>
    <p>If your benefits stopped because of your earnings level, and you are no longer able to work because of your medical condition, or one related to it, you can request to have your benefits reinstated without having to complete a new application. While Social Security determines your benefits reinstatement, you are eligible to receive temporary benefits for up to six months. </p>
    <h3>Plan To Achieve Self-Support (PASS)</h3>
    <p>A PASS plan allows money or assets to be set aside that would normally make an individual ineligible for SSI. A specific work goal must be defined and approved. The PASS can include savings for supplies to start a business, school expenses, equipment, tools, transportation, mobility devices, vehicle, accommodations, uniforms and other work related expenses.</p>
    <p>The PASS is helpful for students, entrepreneurs, or anyone on SSI with a goal of returning to work but in need items or services to reach this goal.</p>
    <p>You can write your own PASS following the SSI format <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/11017.html" target="_blank">(PASS form (SSA-545-BK)  <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>&nbsp;or receive help from a VR counselor or other advisors. If your goal is self-employment you will also need to submit a business plan that matches the complexity of your business idea. </p>
    <h3>Student Earned Income Exclusion (SEIE)</h3>
    <p>Students under the age of 22 and regularly attending school can earn $1,780 (2016) of income per month without having it affect the SSI benefit amount. The maximum yearly amount that may be excluded is $7,180 (2016). Regularly attending school is defined differently if in high school, college, home-schooled, or tutored due to disability. The Social Security Administration provides a <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/spotlights/spot-student-earned-income.htm" target="_blank">Spotlight on Student Earned Income Exclusion <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>.</p>
