    <h3>A National Network of Advocacy in Rehabilitation</h3>
    

<p>Client Assistance Programs (CAPs) were created in Section 112 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to help persons with disabilities obtain rehabilitation services. CAP provides assistance to persons with disabilities who seek or receive services under the Rehabilitation Act. Every CAP is authorized to: </p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>help      people understand and access rehabilitation services; </li>
  <li>advise      people about services and benefits available through rehabilitation      programs and about their rights and responsibilities related to those services      and benefits; </li>
  <li>upon      request, assist people in their relationships with service providers; </li>
  <li>assist      people in pursuing appeals and other remedies to ensure that their rights      under the Rehabilitation Act are protected; and </li>
  <li>provide      access to state and other rehabilitation programs to improve their      delivery of services. </li>
</ol>
<p>The CAP can help resolve issues such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>VR services have been denied or delayed</li>
  <li>Help getting VR services</li>
  <li>You have been told you cannot get help from VR</li>
  <li>No VR plan is being developed due to a disagreement about goals</li>
  <li>VR is not helping you find a job</li>
  <li>Your VR counselor is not returning calls or communicating with you</li>
</ul>
<p>CAPs across the country carry out these activities in a variety of ways: direct client representation, information and referral, outreach, community training, development and distribution of self-advocacy materials, committee and council representation on behalf of the rehabilitation client population, public testimony and communication/advocacy to state and other agencies involved in the delivery of rehabilitation services.</p>
  <p>For information about the Client Assistance Program in your area, call your state Vocational Rehabilitation agency.</p>

  Note: CAP offices must make their information available in alternative formats such as Braille, large print or audiotape if needed by individuals with disabilities. Also, many CAPs have information available in Spanish.</p>
