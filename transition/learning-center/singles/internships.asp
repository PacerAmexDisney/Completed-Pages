    <p>For a student with disabilities, transitioning to the world of work requires careful planning, often involving the cooperative efforts of the student and his or her family members, along with school personnel, adult service providers and employers. Planning for employment involves the discovery of a student&rsquo;s interests, skills and dreams and how each of these may relate to potential employment. Internships provide a way to explore the employment world. </p>
    <h2>Why Seek an Internship?</h2>
    <p>Competition for jobs continues to increase.  A potential employee is expected to be more qualified than the next person.  Employers want recent graduates to have some experience.  &ldquo;Ninety-five percent of employers have said that candidate experience is a factor in hiring decisions&rdquo; (Hansen, Katharine, n.d.).</p>
    <p>If you are a high school or college student, the critical next step to employment might be securing an internship to build work experience.  Internships can greatly enhance classroom learning because you are gaining knowledge of your chosen field.</p>
    <h2>What is an Internship?</h2>
    <p>An internship is a professional work experience.  During an internship, you are actively performing duties and responsibilities in the workplace that support and benefit the business (Grossman, Susanne, n.d.).   Internships can take place in all sizes and types of workplace settings, including banks, radio and television stations, hospitals, government agencies, and non-profit organizations. Usually internships are unpaid. Some employers require that internships be completed for college credit. Completing an internship can be very beneficial as you plan for the world of work.</p>
    <div class="alertBox">
    <p>&ldquo;Mary Margaret is an undergraduate business major at the University of St. Thomas.  She attended a university sponsored campus job fair, where she impressed the recruiter from a major marketing company.  The recruiter recommended her for one of the company’s internships.   Mary Margaret interned at this company the summer before her senior year. She attended monthly staff meetings, worked with a team of marketing researchers, and had the opportunity to assist one of the company’s executives in creating a mentoring program for middle school students.&rdquo; </p>
    </div>
    <h2>The Benefits of Internships</h2>
    <p>Internships can provide you with a sense of the work environment – the rhythm of working, culture, duties, and responsibilities.  Internships offer you relevant experience that employers seek.  Today, a growing number of colleges and universities require that their students complete an internship and offer credit for doing so.  Other benefits of completing and internship include: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Understanding the relevance of your coursework and employment</em><strong>.   </strong>Many students experience a greater understanding of their major field of college study.  Completing an internship may leave you better prepared and with a greater understanding of how your coursework is related to your intended area of employment. </li>
      <li><em>Building work habits</em><strong>.  </strong>Internships provide numerous opportunities to practice technical skills needed for the job and &ldquo;soft skills&rdquo; needed to be successful in employment. You will learn the rhythm of working, the importance of getting to the job on time, how to ask questions to complete work assignments, how to dress suitably, and how to interact appropriately with customers and co-workers.   </li>
      <li><em>Gaining confidence.</em><strong> </strong> There is usually an intern supervisor or support person at the work assignment who directly supervises you on the job. This individual can help guide you in overcoming some of your concerns or fears associated with working.  Think of your internship as practice in the work environment, and use it to gain confidence in your abilities. </li>
      <li><em>Feedback from your supervisor. </em> When you meet with your supervisor, take the opportunity to ask questions about your strengths and weaknesses.  It&rsquo;s a great opportunity to learn more </li>
      <li><em>Trying out a career path</em><strong>.</strong> Along with a chance to try out skills and work habits, internships will help you try your intended career paths to see if a particular career is a good fit for you.  If you discover that a particular career path is not a good fit, you can take the opportunity to see about testing out other interests, abilities and skills while in a work environment. </li>
      <li><em>Building a network of resources</em><strong>.</strong>  Internships provide great opportunities for building networks of resources through both professional associations affiliated with your intended profession and individuals who can help guide you toward your future.  Often this network of &ldquo;who you know&rdquo; can help by providing reference letters, suggestions, and recommendations for improving your work skills, along with pointing you toward potential employers. </li>
      <li><em>Practice using job accommodations and assistive technology</em>. A &ldquo;job accommodation&rdquo; is any modification to workplace duties or environment that helps a person with a disability do the essential functions of a job.  For example, a worker with back pain may benefit from a standing work station.  In many cases, assistive technology can act as the job accommodation.  One example might be a screen reader for a worker with a vision disability.  Internships are a great opportunity for you to learn what possible job accommodations or assistive technology will allow you to be successful at work. </li>
    </ul>
   <h2>Where Do I Find an Internship?</h2>
   <p>Looking for an internship is good practice for finding a job.  Planning, searching, applying, and accepting are all processes that apply whether you are looking for an internship or looking for a job. </p>
   <p>It is important to cover all possibilities when looking for internships.  Look for connections at school, through your family and friends, and anywhere you can think of that might offer an internship in your field of interest.  Potential action steps include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Checking your school&rsquo;s database.</li>
      <li> Researching the campus job search office along with attending campus and community sponsored job fairs. </li>
      <li>Checking with your state&rsquo;s Vocational Rehabilitation Program if there is a list of available internships for students with disabilities. </li>
      <li>Networking and speaking with alumni from your postsecondary education program.</li>
      <li>Discussing internships with personnel in cooperative education classes. </li>
      <li>Seeking out former and present teachers for their advice and guidance. </li>
      <li>Talking with friends of your family along with fellow students.  Personal networks often are the best sources for leads.</li>
      <li>Researching websites, trade and community newspapers, and general job listings. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>An internship is a great way to learn about a particular profession, explore employment options, develop and foster new networks, explore workplace cultures, and learn if a particular career path is right for you.  For youth with disabilities, internships can also be an excellent opportunity to identify and practice useful job accommodations and assistive technologies.  Workplace success requires preparation and practice and both can be gained through a quality internship.</p>
