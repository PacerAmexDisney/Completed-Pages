<p>Going to college today can mean attending a 4-year college or university, a 2-year community college, or a technical institute or trade school. It can mean working toward a bachelor&rsquo;s degree, an associate&rsquo;s degree (A.A.), or a certificate showing mastery of skills needed for a technical career. It can mean studying full-time or part-time, or living at school or commuting from home. </p>
<p>Preparing for college includes taking any necessary assessments (e.g. SATs), ensuring current diagnostic test results are available to document the student's disability, developing self-advocacy skills, and other steps depending on the selected type of college program.</p>
