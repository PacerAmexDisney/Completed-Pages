   <h1><strong>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) turns 25</strong></h1>
   
   <p>The landmark Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), one of the United States&rsquo; most important pieces of civil rights legislation, was signed into law on July 26, 1990 by President George H.W. Bush. There are reminders of ADA&rsquo;s impact everywhere you look, from designated parking spaces for people with disabilities to curb cuts on city streets. ADA also allowed for equal access for individuals with service animals and mandated Braille signage in public buildings.</p>
     <p>Celebrations have been held across the country this summer to mark the anniversary of the ADA, which provides equal opportunities for people with disabilities in the areas of employment, transportation, state and local government, public accommodations, and telecommunications. It protects anyone with mobility, visual, or hearing impairments, or cognitive disabilities. &ldquo;I was honored to be at the signing of the ADA on the White House lawn on July 26, 1990! I was pleased to share in this very important legislation and to shake the President&rsquo;s hand,&rdquo; said PACER Executive Director Paula Goldberg. &ldquo;It was amazing.&rdquo;</p>
     <p>There were many challenging years of activism, protests, and political controversy leading to the passage of the ADA, which was a product of compromise. The result was the world&rsquo;s first comprehensive legal declaration of equality for people with disabilities. Today it protects &ldquo;56.7 million Americans with disabilities – about 19 percent of the country&rsquo;s population based on the 2010 census&rdquo;, according to the ADA National Network.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Three weeks ago we celebrated our nation&rsquo;s Independence Day,&rdquo; President Bush said at the signing ceremony in 1990. &ldquo;Today we&rsquo;re here to rejoice in and celebrate another &lsquo;independence day,&rsquo; one that is long overdue. With today&rsquo;s signing of the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act, every man, woman, and child with a disability can now pass through once-closed doors into a bright new era of equality, independence, and freedom.&rdquo;</p>
     <p>At one large celebration in July, more than 3,000 people participated in New York City&rsquo;s first Disability Pride Parade. Tom Harkin, the former U.S. Senator from Iowa, was the grand marshal. He sponsored the Americans with Disabilities Act 25 years ago and has been a leader in disability rights for decades. &ldquo;I may be retired from the Senate, but I am not retired from the fight,&rdquo; he told the Associated Press at the parade. &ldquo;We know that when companies hire people with disabilities they get the best workers, the most loyal workers, the most productive workers.&rdquo;</p>
     <p>Goldberg agrees with Harkins&rsquo; assessment. &ldquo;The ADA has no doubt expanded opportunities for many Americans with disabilities in many areas of life,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but there is so much more to be done, particularly in the area of employment opportunities.&rdquo;</p>
     <p>Research shows that there is a strong correlation between completion of postsecondary education and training and success in the workplace. PACER&rsquo;s National Parent Center on Transition and Employment is at the forefront of efforts to ensure that individuals with disabilities are prepared for the world of work, and that employers recognize the skills and abilities these individuals bring to the table. &ldquo;Most young adults with disabilities want to work and are preparing themselves to do well in the workplace,&rdquo; Goldberg said. &ldquo;PACER is committed to helping individuals be successful.&rdquo;  </p>
