            <p>Some 20% to 65% of children worldwide say they suffer from bullying,  but that proportion may be higher because school violence is &quot;notoriously  under-reported&quot;, the report says.</p>
            <p> In the US, around a fifth of high school students said they  experienced repeated, intentional bullying, according to data collected by the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Indeed, the prevalence of  bullying is so high that CDC treats it as a public health issue.</p>

            <p>Because IEP decisions are made by a team rather than by any one individual, it&rsquo;s important and helpful to understand the role of each member. While each person brings a different set of experiences, concerns, and skills to the table, you can expect that they all share a common goal: enabling the child to succeed in school and in life.</p>
