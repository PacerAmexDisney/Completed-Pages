<p class="date">Posted: November 30, 2011</p>
<p>ST. PAUL, Minn. - One week after the state's attorney general proposed tougher laws for reporting bullying at school, Gov. Mark Dayton announced an executive order that will establish a bullying task force to engage students and recommend changes.</p>
<p>Minnesota has one of the weakest bullying laws in the nation, and Dayton said that's why the group of no more than 15 -- including the commissioners of education and public safety -- is important. <a href="http://www.myfoxtwincities.com/dpp/news/politics/dayton-creates-bullying-task-force-with-executive-order-nov-29-2011" target="_blank">Read More<span class="extralinktext"> about Dayton's bullying task force executive order</span></a></p>

<h3 class="related">Minnesota Public Radio reports on Gov. Mark Dayton's announcement of a new task force to review the state's bullying prevention law.</h3>
<p class="date">Posted: November 30, 2011</p>
<p> St. Paul, Minn. &mdash; 																																				Gov. Mark Dayton says he'd like to update the state's bullying prevention law, but he's unlikely to push for changes before the 2013 session. </p>
<p> Dayton on Tuesday announced a task force to consider options for changing the law and other bullying prevention policies. However, that panel's recommendations won't be due until next summer, after next year's session is over. </p>
<p> The governor said Minnesotans would universally agree that students deserve to go to school without fear of being bullied or harassed &mdash; but that's not happening.</p>
<p>&quot;Children in Minnesota being subjected to a form of harassement; a form of emotional torture &mdash; and people in authority are not responding and not preventing that and not acting upon it,&quot; Dayton said. &quot;It's just something that's so un-Minnesotan that it's hard to fathom.&quot; </p>

<p>GOLDEN VALLEY, Minn. -- It knows no boundaries and, no matter the school, it's likely somebody has suffered from bullying at least one time or another. </p>
<p>&quot;I was picked on for what race I looked like and so I found myself not liking being half black or half white cause other people didn't like it,&quot; explained Tessa Gundy. </p>
<p>&quot;All my life I've been bullied due to my hearing loss that I was born with,&quot; added Michael Moen. </p>
<p>On Wednesday, a flash mob-like dance at the Perpich Center for Arts Education is meant to help all that have been bullied before. The &quot;Unity Dance Day&quot; is sponsored by Pacer's National Bullying Prevention Center.

<p class="date">Posted: October 17, 2011</p>
<p><strong>A new national survey of 1,000 adults with children commissioned by the Child Mind Institute investigated parents' awareness of and concerns about psychiatric and learning issues in their children. The key findings were as follows:</strong></p>
<ol>
 <li>Nearly one in four parents, or 22%, reports being concerned about a child's mental health.</li>
 <li>Children identified by their parents as having mental health issues show more than double the rate of problematic and dangerous behaviors&mdash;including alcohol and drug abuse, suspension from school, and suicide attempts&mdash;of children in the whole sample.</li>
 <li>While most parents with concerns sought treatment (87%), almost half (43%) waited more than a year and nearly a quarter (22%) waited more than two years to get help.</li>

<p><strong>NORTHFIELD, Minn. (WCCO) &mdash; </strong>Bullies are forcing more than 160,000 kids across the country to stay home from school every day.&nbsp;Fear of an attack or intimidation can have an impact that lasts a lifetime.<br />
Kelly Miland, 20, knows firsthand how terrifying it can be to become the target of a bully.<br />
&ldquo;Back then, I didn&rsquo;t know what bullying was until a couple of years later,&rdquo; said Kelly, who was the victim of a bully.<br />
During her freshman year at Northfield High School, her family noticed a change in her normally upbeat personality.</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Education today released the final regulations for the early intervention program under Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).

<h3 class="related">State Performance Plan Process And Indicators</h3>
<p class="date">Posted: August 29, 2011</p>
<p>The reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) in 2004 and the related regulations adopted in 2006 brought significant changes in federal monitoring of states' implementation of the federal law. The requirements in Sections 616 and 642 of the law required that each state develop a State Performance Plan (SPP) to evaluate its efforts in implementing the requirements and purposes of IDEA and describe how it will improve its implementation over a period of six years. IDEA also requires each state to report annually to the U.S. Secretary of Education on the progress it has made that year in meeting the measurable and rigorous targets established in its six-year SPP. This is known as the Annual Performance Report (APR).</p>
<p> The Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) at the U.S. Department of Education (ED) asked Project Forum, in collaboration with the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities' Education Taskforce to conduct a policy forum to obtain broad stakeholder input on implementation of the SPP/APR system to assist OSEP in its review of the impact of the SPP/APR and recommendations to make it more child and family outcome-oriented. Prior to the forum, OSEP held two webinars for forum participants to review aspects of the SPP/APR requirements and process. <a href="http://projectforum.org/docs/StatePerformancePlanProcessandIndicators.pdf" target="_blank">Read the Findings here.</a></p>

<p> The National Center for Learning Disabilities (NCLD) released its biennial report: <a href="http://www.ncld.org/stateofld" title="State of Learning Disabilities" target="_blank"><em>State of Learning Disabilities: Facts, Trends and Indicators</em></a>. This publication provides the authoritative national and state-by-state snapshot of learning disabilities (LD) in the United States.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The report looks at the impact of learning disabilities on the educational success and employment of individuals with LD and also clarifies what is, and what is not, a learning disability.</p>
<p>Key findings of the report include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
 <li>2.5 million public school students have learning disabilities and are eligible to receive special education &ndash; representing 42% of the 5.9 million students with disabilities, down from a high of over 50% a decade ago. </li>
 <li>Learning disabilities do not include conditions such as Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, intellectual disabilities, autism, deafness and blindness yet such conditions are often confused with LD. </li>
 <li>More students with LD are graduating with a regular high school diploma (64%) than only a decade ago (52%) and fewer students with learning disabilities are dropping out of school (22%) than in 1999 (40%). </li>
 <li>Students with LD attend postsecondary education at lower rates than their non-disabled peers. Only 10% of students with learning disabilities enrolled in a 4-year college within 2 years of leaving high school.</li>
 <li>Adults with learning disabilities still struggle to find employment (55% employed) compared to their non-disabled peers (76% employed) with 39% of adults with LD not in the workforce.</li>
