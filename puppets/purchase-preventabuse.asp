  <!--BEGIN CONTENT-->
  <p>The LET'S PREVENT ABUSE Program helps children and adults gain information about child physical and sexual abuse as well as helps children to develop personal safety skills. This puppet program originated in 1984, in response to a growing awareness of the greater vulnerability of children with disabilities to all types of abuse. More than 83,000 children and adults have viewed the program presentation. </p>
  <p> LET'S PREVENT ABUSE features four endearing multicultural, child-size puppets that portray children with and without disabilities. These puppets have proven to be a comfortable medium through which to teach children about abuse prevention. Opportunities exist throughout the program for the children to interact with the puppets through dialogue and role-play. </p>
  <p> The performances, designed for children in grades 1-4*, address: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The definitions of physical and sexual abuse;</li>
    <li>How to get help and whom to tell;</li>
    <li>The need for children to talk about the abuse if they are in such a 
      situation;</li>
    <li>Feelings of guilt, isolation and shame associated with abuse; and</li>
    <li>It's never a child's fault when they have been abused.</li>
  </ul>
