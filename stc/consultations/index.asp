<!--BEGIN CONTENT-->

<p>A consultation at PACER is a way to explore educational assistive technology in a stress-free, collaborative environment. This is <strong>not</strong> a formal assessment or evaluation but rather a <strong>starting point</strong> to locate technology that may help people with disabilities become more independent at home, school, or work. The PACER Simon Technology Center (STC) offers free, informal assistive technology consultations for children and adults with disabilities to families in Minnesota. A consultation fee is charged to families who would like an assistive technology consultation but live outside of Minnesota. Please note this service is separate from our fee-based <a href="../individualtrainings.asp">Individualized Training</a> service.
</p>
<p>
If interested, please submit the appropriate consultation form (online or mail), or call PACER Center at 952-838-9000.

<h3>Technology Consultation Process</h3>
<p><strong>Although the consultation is provided free of charge, a $50 refundable deposit must be received by the STC prior to scheduling and appointment</strong>. This refundable deposit holds your appointment. Your deposit will be returned to you at the consultation. Consultation appointments are scheduled during the business hours Monday - Friday  at the PACER Simon Technology Center. Each consultation lasts approximately one to one-and-a half hours.</p>

  <p><strong>Due to high demand, consultations are currently being scheduled out 1 - 3 months from the date your consultation application and deposit are received by PACER.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;We will make every attempt to accommodate your schedule however applications are accepted on a first come, first serve basis and appointments cannot be scheduled until a deposit is on file.</p>
</div>
<h4>Before the Consultation</h4>
<p>Once the application form and deposit are received, an assistive technology specialist will be in contact to schedule the consultation. Because the consultation is customized to meet individual needs, the assistive technology specialist may ask further questions to best determine appropriate assistive technology.</p>
<h4>During the Consultation</h4>
<p>We encourage a team approach and recommend that the child or adult with a disability, family members, teachers, and professionals be present during the consultation. During the consultation, the assistive technology specialist will provide guidance and &ldquo;hands-on&rdquo; experiences based on the information provided on the application form. The assistive technology specialist will demonstrate a variety of software and adaptive equipment such as alternative keyboards, voice recognition, augmentative communication devices, and switches. Information about purchasing or upgrading technology, where to buy software and peripherals, and how to hook up adaptive equipment will be discussed during the consultation. At the end of the consultation, the assistive technology specialist will return your $50 deposit and explain the services of the STC Library, if appropriate.</p>
