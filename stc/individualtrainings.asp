 <h4>Comments from others on Individualized Training Sessions:</h4>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>&ldquo;You have no idea how much you helped me. Now that I have the basics, I am off and running. You showed me that the program is not complicated, and it definitely is easy. I wish I had come to you sooner instead of worrying about my lack of understanding of this program for so long. Thank you so much for all your help and patience.&rdquo;</em><br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; Mother of an adult who uses an augmentative and alternative communication app for speech</p>
    <p><em>&ldquo;Thank you! The specialist who worked with us was well-prepared and talked in an organized and understandable way. The software program we came in for training on had been sitting for a year unused, but since our session with you our daughter and I have both been customizing the software and  have much more confidence about how to use the program.  Now we have a powerful tool to help my daughter access information and to be able to express herself. Thumbs up the whole way around!&rdquo;</em><br />
