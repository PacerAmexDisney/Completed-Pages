			<li><strong>Training</strong> - Project KITE trains participants in using technology to support inclusion of the children in school and family activities. </li>
			<li><strong>Technology Access</strong> - KITE provides access to technology for participants through hands-on trainings in our computer lab, and through the Simon Technology Center Library. Computers, software, and other devices are available for loan to Project KITE participants. </li>
			<li><strong>Technical Assistance</strong> - During and after training sessions, Project KITE provides technical assistance via information and referral regarding assistive technology devices, funding, selection, and use. </li>
