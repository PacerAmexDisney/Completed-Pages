				<p>This workshop kicks off the  Project KITE workshop series by covering two essential topics for parents and  educators alike:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Various types  and uses of assistive technology </li>
					<li>Effective  strategies for exploring, discussing and implementing assistive technology in a  young child&rsquo;s education. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>A range of assistive technology, from low tech adaptations to mobile  apps, will be demonstrated and discussed during this workshop, providing  parents and educators alike with ideas and inspiration for their child, student,  and classroom. This session is part one of a unique five-part workshop  experience. </p>

			<td><h3>The Power of Visual Supports and Strategies for Young Learners</h3>
				<p>When it comes to young  children, a picture really is worth a thousand words. For many early learners, a  thousand words makes up a considerable portion of their expressive and  receptive vocabularies. In this workshop, we will explore how the creative use  of visuals can boost the behavioral, literary, and communicative potential of  young children in home and school settings. Participants will learn about a  wide range of visual supports and strategies, from low-tech drawings to high-tech  mobile apps. Parents and professionals will also be directed to free or low-cost  methods of creating their own visual supports for their child, student, or classroom.  This workshop is part 2 of a 5-part series.</p>

			<td><h3>Early Literacy and Assistive Technology: Making Literacy Accessible and  Engaging for Young Learners</h3>
				<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that young  children learn through play. This certainly holds true for the way children  develop literacy skills. In this workshop, participants will discover how  assistive technology can help engage and motivate young children in their  exploration and use of literacy skills. We will explore and demonstrate everything  from entertaining, messy play dough activities to mobile app technology,  providing both parents and educators with fun activities and ideas to enrich  the child&rsquo;s literary skills. This workshop is part 3 of a 5-part series. &nbsp;</p>

			<td><h3>Ingenious Low Tech Assistive Technology Solutions for Young Learners</h3>
				<p>It does not always require a  large financial investment to make a significant impact on learning.  Participants in this workshop will discover how a few dollars spent at their  local arts and craft store could have a huge payoff in a young child&rsquo;s  education and daily life. A variety of low-tech solutions for communication,  handwriting, sensory needs, and more will be discussed and demonstrated providing  parents and educators alike with ideas and inspiration for their child, student,  and classroom. Participants will also be directed to a variety of online  resources, including useful social media pages, for more ideas and tutorials  for low-tech solutions. This workshop is part 4 of a 5-part series.</p>

			<td><h3>Assistive Technology for the Communication Needs of Young Learners</h3>
				<p>One of the most important  and empowering skills a young child can have is the ability to communicate.  Participants in this workshop will discover how assistive technology can  strengthen and enable the communication skills of young children. A wide  variety of alternative and augmentative communication (AAC) solutions will be  demonstrated and discussed, ranging from simple do-it-yourself solutions to high-tech  apps and dedicated communication devices. This workshop is part 5 of a 5-part  series.</p>
