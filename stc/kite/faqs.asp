		<h3 class="question">Who are the professionals  besides the classroom teacher?</h3>
		<p class="answer">The other professional can be a paraprofessional, personal care attendant PCS, speech language pathologist, occupational therapist, OT, etc. There is more flexibility with this position, but it needs to be someone either working in the classroom that the focus child is in, or someone working directly with the focus child.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="q8">
		<h3 class="question">Where are the trainings held?</h3>
		<p class="answer">The trainings are held in the local community where the team members live. Once a community is selected, team members may need to assist Project KITE coordinators in determining an appropriate facility or classroom for the trainings.</p>

		<h3 class="question">What technology do you provide?</h3>
		<p class="answer">We loan each team an iPad with identical applications and other technical equipment for use both in the home and in the classroom during the 3 – 4 months of Project KITE at your location. Families and professionals are also able to check items out from the Simon Technology Center lending library for a full year free of charge. Each team and the KITE staff will discuss its unique technology needs and will work together to best meet them for the duration of the project.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="q13">

Participants may not download items in addition to what is preloaded.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="q15">

		<p class="answer">Technology is available for the duration of the project and must be returned at the end of the Semester.   </p>
	</li>
	<li id="q16">
		<h3 class="question">Can we check items out of the STC Software Lending Library?</h3>
		<p class="answer">Yes, each parent receives a year-long membership to the STC Software Lending Library. Professionals, including classroom teachers, will receive year-long memberships for their organizations.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="q17">
		<h3 class="question">Does Project KITE pay for substitute teachers?</h3>
		<p class="answer">Our grants do not provide for compensation for substitutes. However, a certificate for up to 20 participation hours will be issued at the end of the semester.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="q18">
		<h3 class="question">What is the philosophy of the KITE Model?</h3>
		<p class="answer">The KITE Model has four distinct components to support the vision of inclusion of young children with disabilities. The Four Ts are:
		<ul>
		<li>Teaming - Project KITE encourages the collaboration of parents, teachers, and professionals.</li>
		<li>Training - Project KITE trains participants in using technology to support inclusion of the children in school and family activities.</li>

		</ul></p>
</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

		</ul>
	</li>
	<li id="q20">
		<h3 class="question">How does Project KITE staff help with integration of technology between training sessions?</h3>
		<p class="answer">Project KITE staff and teams will work together to integrate technology into existing routines and activities. This integration occurs throughout the course of the Project KITE program and includes: 
		<ul>
			<li>Helpful tips for including early learners with their peers, </li>
			<li>Suggestions for proper setup and usage of existing technology in the home and classroom, </li>
			<li>Adaptation of existing curriculum activities to ensure accessibility and engagement among all learners, </li>
