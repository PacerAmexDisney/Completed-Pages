        <h1>Including Assistive Technology (AT) in School</h1>
		
        <p>Including AT in the  schools is guided by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), a  federal law related to educational services for children with disabilities age  birth through 21, in a process called consideration.&nbsp; The consideration of  assistive technology is part of the process of developing an Individual Family  Service Plan (IFSP) for children ages birth to 3 and developing an Individual  Education Program (IEP) for children ages 3 to 5.</p>
        <p>Many providers are using  assistive technology but may not recognize it as assistive technology. This  lack of understanding about the full range and scope of assistive technology  often leads to statements that there is no need for assistive technology when  in fact it is written throughout the IFSP or IEP document. The TIKES Project  strives to help parents and providers understand the process of consideration  and to properly document their consideration in the IFSP and IEP.</p>
        <h2>Including  Assistive Technology in the Individual Family Service Plan (IFSP) and  Individual Education Program (IEP)</h2>
        <p>          The Individuals with  Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is a federal law related to educational  services for children with disabilities age birth through 21. According to this  federal law, the use of assistive technology (AT) must be considered during the  IFSP or IEP process. However, what this consideration should look like is not  outlined in the law. It is generally a short discussion during an initial or  annual IFSP or IEP meeting.&nbsp; The TIKES Project has created planning  documents to provide families, teachers, and other professionals a way to be  intentional about the process of considering assistive technology and ensure it  is included in both the process and IFSP/IEP document. &nbsp;</p>
        <p>The planning  documents, handouts and other supporting materials are included below. </p>
