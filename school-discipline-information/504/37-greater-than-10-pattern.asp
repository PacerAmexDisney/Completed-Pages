  <h2>The Discipline is:</h2>
  <p>an  <span class="def" id="out-of-school-suspension">out-of-school suspension*</span> that exceeds a total of 10 consecutive <span class="def" id="school-days">school days*</span> or  exceeds 10 school days when combined  with other out-of-school suspensions this school year  and constitutes a pattern of removals.</p>
</div>
  <h2>Response:</h2>
  <p>A <span class="def" id="manifestation-determination">manifestation determination*</span> meeting must then  be held by a group of persons knowledgeable about your child, the meaning of  the Section 504 evaluation data, and the placement options to decide whether  your child&rsquo;s behavior was caused by or had a direct and substantial  relationship to his or her disability.</p>
<p>In  making this decision, the team should consider all relevant information,  including:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>your child&rsquo;s complete educational  record  </li>
  <li>a current evaluation, including  diagnostic results or other relevant information supplied by you</li>
  <li>your child&rsquo;s <span class="def" id="504">Section 504 Plan*</span> and placement,  including information on whether the plan or placement were appropriate and implemented.  </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="tip">Tip: Section 504 requires  that a child be re-evaluated before any change in placement, including a  disciplinary change of placement.<sup class="statute">1</sup> You should request  such a re-evaluation in writing. Unless you agree otherwise or the behavior in  question involved the use of illegal drugs, or alcohol, your child should remain  in his or her current placement until the re-evaluation is completed. However,  unlike the IDEA, there is no explicit &ldquo;stay put&rdquo; entitlement under Section 504  that parents can assert to ensure their child remains in the current  educational placement.</p>
  <h2>Options:</h2>
  
  <p>If the behavior involved the <strong>use</strong> of drugs or  alcohol or the behavior involved possession and the school can establish that  your child is currently using drugs or alcohol, the protections of Section 504  do not apply and your child may be disciplined the same as a student without a  disability. However, the district must provide alternative educational services  to the extent a suspension or expulsion exceeds five consecutive school days.<sup class="statute">2</sup>&nbsp; </p>

  <p>Provided the behavior did not  include drug or alcohol <strong>use</strong>, a <span class="def" id="manifestation-determination">manifestation determination*</span> meeting must  then be held by a group of persons knowledgeable about your child, the meaning  of the Section 504 evaluation data, and the placement options to decide whether  your child&rsquo;s behavior was caused by or had a direct and substantial  relationship to his or her disability.</p>
