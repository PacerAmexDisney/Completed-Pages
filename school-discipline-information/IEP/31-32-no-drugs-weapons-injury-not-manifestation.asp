  <h2>The manifestation team determined that my child's behavior was:</h2>
  <p>not a manifestation of his or her  disability and the behavior did not involve <span class="def" id="drugs">drugs*</span>, <span class="def" id="weapon">weapons*</span>, or <span class="def" id="bodily-injury">serious bodily injury*</span>.</p>
</div>
  <h2>Response: </h2>
<p>The  school district may suspend or expel your child just as it would any student  without a disability. It must, however, continue to provide a free appropriate  education (FAPE) during the suspension or expulsion, although it may be in a  different educational setting.<sup class="statute">1</sup> In the case of termination of bus services, the school must provide alternative  transportation to and from your child’s educational placement.</p>
<p><a href="/school-discipline-information/IEP/17-suspension-bus.asp">Go to the Termination of Bus Services Section &gt;&gt;&gt;</a></p>
<p class="tip">Tip: You should request a  Functional Behavioral Assessment (FBA) as well as a Behavior Intervention Plan  (BIP), designed to address  the behavior violation so that it does not recur. If the student already has  and FBA and a BIP, you should ask the Team to review them to determine if they  remain appropriate.</p>
<p class="tip">TIP: If the discipline is  an expulsion, the school must offer your child alternative educational services  before beginning expulsion proceedings.<sup class="statute">2</sup> You may choose to accept the alternative placement instead of going forward  with the expulsion proceedings. It is always a good idea to visit the proposed  placement before making a decision.</p>
<p class="tip">Tip: Section 504 of the  Rehabilitation Act requires that a child receive a re-evaluation before a  change in educational placement.<sup class="statute">3</sup> This has been  interpreted to apply to a student expelled or suspended for more than 10 school  days in a school year when those suspensions are part of a pattern of removals.  As a general rule, all children on IEPs also fall under Section 504, so you may  make a written request that a re-evaluation be completed before the school  proceeds with the discipline. </p>
<p class="tip">Tip: When considering  alternative educational settings, the IEP team must consider more than one  option, such as homebound services, to meet your child’s needs. Remember, even  alternative settings for disciplinary reasons must be appropriate and allow  your child to continue to progress in the general curriculum as well as in  achieving his or her IEP goals.</p>
