<h2>Dropout Prevention</h2>

<p>Students who drop out of school often face a difficult future. For students with disabilities, the risks are intensified. Their dropout rate is about 40 percent--more than twice that of their peers without disabilities. However, families can play an important role in making sure their student with or without disabilities graduates. It is critical for parents to stay involved in their teen's life during middle school and high school. </p>
<p>PACER Center collaborates with state and national agencies and organizations to address dropout prevention for students with disabilities, with a focus on encouraging effective parent involvement with their transition-aged youth. </p>
