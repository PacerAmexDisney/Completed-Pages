<h2>Ideas to Improve Parent-to-Professional Communication with School Staff</h2>

<p>PACER&rsquo;s parent advocates often hear from parents when 
they encounter certain statements or situations at school 
meetings that they find uncomfortable or uncertain. These 
tips are suggestions and techniques from PACER advocates 
to help parents address some of those concerns, as well as 
improve communication with school staff. </p>
<table id="statements" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="5" style="clear:right;">
<tr>
<th>Statement or Situation</th>
<th>You May Want to Ask</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>school staff presents a new idea that you may be 
  interested in</td>
  <td><p>&ldquo;What will it take to 
    make that happen?&rdquo;</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>a school IEP team member expresses something that 
  you think may be an opinion</td><td><p>&ldquo;Is 
    that an opinion or do you have data I can see to support 
    it?&rdquo;</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>you are uncertain about something in your child’s 
  school day</td><td><p>&ldquo;What does this look 
    like in Johnnie’s day?&rdquo;</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>a school IEP team member says, “Your son refuses to 
  ___,”</td><td><p>&ldquo;Is that something he can’t or doesn’t know how to do rather than refuses to do?&rdquo;</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>a school staff member says, “We don’t have the money 
  to do that,”</td><td><p>&ldquo;I understand that the school 
    district has financial concerns. However, we are here to 
    talk about what my child needs for a free, appropriate 
    public education.” </p>
    <p>Or you might say, “Please put that in 
      writing for me.”</p></td></tr>

<tr>
  <td>a school staff member says &mdash; “We don’t know (the 
  answer to a particular question, concern, problem, or 
  issue)” &mdash; without offering a way to find the answer</td><td><p>&ldquo;Who can we invite to the meeting to  
    help find the answer?&rdquo;</p></td></tr>

<tr>
  <td> you are trying something new</td><td><p>&ldquo;How will we know that it is working?&quot; and “How will 
  data on success be collected?</p></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>you want input from a specific IEP team member</td>
<td><p>&ldquo;What is your professional opinion?&rdquo;</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>an important agreement, decision, or promise is made</td><td><p>ask to have it put into writing</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>you are bringing a problem to the IEP team that needs 
  solving</td><td><p>try to clearly present the problem and then 
    brainstorm solutions with the team</p></td></tr>
</table>
<h4>General Tips:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Ask a question once and then listen for the answer. </li>
    <li>Keep the main thing the main thing. Too many
  details may only distract from your priorities.</li>
  	<li>When action is required, always ask who will be
  responsible for seeing that it is done.</li>
  	<li>Thank the members of the IEP team or specific 
  teachers whenever possible and appropriate.</li>
  </ul>
