	<h2>Recommended Reading</h2>
    <p>If your child has an IEP or will be getting one, we recommend starting with:</p>
    <p><a href="/parent/php/PHP-a12.pdf" target="_blank"> A Guide for Minnesota Parents to the Individualized Education Program (IEP) <span class="fa fa-file-pdf-o"></span> <span class="fa fa-external-link"></span></a></p>
    <div class="centered"><a href="/parent/php/PHP-a12.pdf"><img src="/parent/images/guide-to-iep-thuhmb.jpg" alt="A guide for minnesota parents to the individualized education program (iep)" width="150" height="175" title="View / Download" /></a></div>
    <p>2014 edition | 42 page pdf</p>
    <p>or Call PACER Center (952-838-9000) for a printed copy, free to MN parents.</p>
</div>
<p>Every child is unique and learns in different ways. If your child has been identified as needing special
education services to support his or her learning at school, you can play a major role in shaping the
services your child receives.</p>
<p>
This section will help you understand the Individualized Education Program (IEP) and the importance
of your participation in developing your child’s IEP Plan. You are a required member of your child’s IEP
team, and your ideas must always be considered in any decisions the IEP team makes.
The development of the IEP is required in the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education
Improvement Act (IDEA 2004), its regulations (known as 34 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] Parts
300 and 301), and in Minnesota state special education rules and statutes. The federal regulations,
which have the force of law, explain how the law will be carried out.</p>
<p>
Each state implements the federal laws somewhat differently. If
your child qualifies for special education and attends a private school, you may call PACER Center for
more information on special education for private school students.</p>
<p>The purpose of special education is<br />
<blockquote>&ldquo;to ensure that all children with disabilities
have available to them a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special
education and related services designed to meet their unique needs and prepare
them for further education, employment, and independent living.&rdquo; &mdash; IDEA 601(d)(1)</blockquote>

<h3><a href="/parent/videos-trainings.asp#PHS1">Video Series:  Parent Homework Sheet</a></h3>
<p>PACER parent advocates have developed a tool called the Parent Homework Sheet. We developed it to help parents of children with disabilities understand how the needs of the student as stated in the special education evaluation report connect with the goals and support in the student&rsquo;s IEP (Individualized Education Program). Watching this series of short videos will help parents prepare to discuss their child&rsquo;s special education services with the IEP team.</p>

	<p>The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)  calls for a team   of individuals, including parents and school personnel, to  work   together to develop an Individual Educational Program (IEP) for a child    who qualifies for special education services. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Because IEP decisions are made by a team rather than by  any one   individual, it&rsquo;s important and helpful to understand the role of each    member. While each person brings a different set of experiences,   concerns, and  skills to the table, you can expect that they all share a   common goal: enabling  the child to succeed in school and in life.</p>

<h3>School Discipline Guide</h3>
	<p>Parents of children with disabilities often ask:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Can the school send my child home before the end of the school day?</li>
      <li>Can the school district suspend my child?</li>
      <li>Can the school district expel my child?</li>
      <li>What happens to my child&rsquo;s educational services if he or she is sent home, suspended, or expelled?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This interactive guide will answer these and many other questions. Whether your child is on an <span id="iep">Individualized Education Plan (IEP)</span> or a <span id="504">Section 504 Plan</span>,    or if you suspect that your child has a disability that affects his or    her behavior at school, this guide will help you understand the    complex disciplinary process for Minnesota public school children with    disabilities.</p>
