<h2>Surrogate Parents</h2>

<p>Congress recognized the importance  of active parents' involvement in   planning their children's educational  programs, monitoring progress,   and challenging inappropriate decisions. This  child advocate role is   usually filled by parents. However, the laws give an  alternative if the   parents of a child with a disability are unknown or  completely   unavailable or if the child is a ward of the state. Surrogate  parents   fill the parental role in these situations. Most often a surrogate is    either a foster parent or a volunteer from the local community.</p>
<p>Surrogate parents play an important  role in a child's education.   The surrogate parent is an advocate for the  student. The more   surrogate parents know and the more comfortable they are with  the   special education process and procedures, the more effective they will   be  in the role of surrogate parent. </p>

<h2 id="intro">Surrogate Parent Laws and Guidelines</h2>
	<h3>Children who need surrogate parents: </h3>
	<p>Students who either already receive special education services or who are thought to need such services are entitled to a free, appropriate public education and may be served by surrogate parents. In Minnesota, this includes students from birth to age 18.</p>
	<p>	  Surrogate parents are appointed under three conditions: (<a href="https://www.revisor.leg.state.mn.us/rules/?id=3525.2440" target="_blank">Minnesota Rule 3525.2440</a>)</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>The parent is unknown or unavailable </li>
	<li>The pupil is a ward of the state </li>
	<li>The parent requests a surrogate parent in writing
	  	<div class="resources">
	    Parents are not usually aware of their right to request a surrogate parent. When a potential situation arises, the parents should be notified of their right to request a surrogate parent. They should also be informed regarding the rights and responsibilities that the surrogate would assume in this role..  
	  	</div>
      </li>
	</ul>
<h3 id="whatissurrogate">What is a surrogate parent?</h3>
	<p>Surrogate parent means a person appointed by a school district to represent a child with a disability who has or may need special education services. This person may not be receiving public funds to educate or care for the child.</p>
	<h3 id="responsibilitiesofsurrogate">Responsibilities of surrogate parents</h3>
	<p>A surrogate parent is only responsible for representing the child when decisions about his/her special education program are made concerning:</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>Identification of the need for the child to receive special education services </li>
	<li>Evaluation to determine his/her individual needs </li>
	<li>Design of his/her individualized education program, including placement </li>
	<li>Ongoing reviews of educational progress </li>
	<li>Disagreement with the school's educational proposals </li>
</ul>
<p>In order to fulfill these responsibilities, the surrogate parent should learn about state and federal requirements for special education and about school district structure and procedures. The surrogate parent should also have an understanding of the pupil's disability and needs and have an ability to effectively advocate for the child. (<a href="https://www.revisor.leg.state.mn.us/rules/?id=3525.2455" target="_blank">Minnesota Rule 3525.2455 <span class="fa fa-external-link"></span></a>)</p>
<p>Although not a legal requirement, it may be best if the surrogate parent and child share a similar background, such as race or culture.</p>
<p>Some other qualities of an effective surrogate parent are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>a commitment to learning about the child's educational needs and special education, and</li>
	<li>an ability to communicate constructively and effectively with school personnel.</li>
</ol>
<p>A surrogate parent appointment may only be removed by the school board. (<a href="https://www.revisor.leg.state.mn.us/rules/?id=3525.2450" target="_blank">Minnesota Rule 3525.2450</a>)</p>

<div class="resources">
    <h3 id="summaryofsurrogate">Summary of surrogate parents and special education</h3>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>All children in special education have a right to a free, appropriate public education. </li>
        <li>Children who do not have parents available must be assigned a surrogate parent. </li>
        <li>A surrogate parent is a person appointed by a school district to represent the child in special education decisions. </li>
        <li>A surrogate parent has the same rights and responsibilities that parents and guardians have in the special education decision-making process. </li>
    </ul>	
    <p><strong>Summary of Responsibilities</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Surrogate</strong> - Carry out the surrogate parent role and to represent the student</li>
        <li><strong>School District</strong> - See that the surrogate parent carries out the role</li>
