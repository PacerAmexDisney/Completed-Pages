      <a name=whatis style="color: black;"><p>What is a SEAC?<br /></p></a>
      <p>A SEAC is a group that provides input on special education issues to its local school district.</p>
      <ul>
        <li value="0">
          <p>Its purpose is to advise and to advocate, not to decide policy.</p>

      <p>Parent Advisory Councils</p>
      <p>  "In order to increase the involvement of parents of children with disabilities in district policy making and decision making, school districts must have a special education advisory council that is incorporated into the district's special education system plan.</p>

      <p>   Once you've joined your local SEAC, it will take time and patience to become a truly effective participant. These techniques can help you find your unique place in the group.</p>
      <ul>
        <li value="0">
          <p>Ask yourself if you feel welcome at the SEAC meeting. If not, ask yourself what you can do to improve the situation.</p>

      <a name=conflict style="color: black;"><p>Dealing with conflict</p></a>
      <p>   SEAC members come from a variety of backgrounds and perspectives. As a result, differences of opinion will inevitably arise. Through flexibility and compromise, your group can resolve its conflicts, reach consensus, strengthen relationships, and accomplish goals.</p>
      <hr />
      <p>   Here are some questions you and the other members may want to ask yourselves as you deal with differences of opinion:</p>
      <ul>
        <li value="0">
          <p>Am I contributing to the conflict or to a resolution?</p>

          <p>Are we being respectful to one another?</p>
        </li>
        <li value="0">
          <p>Have we defined the "problem" before starting to propose solutions? (We may be disagreeing because we aren't solving the same "problem.")</p>
