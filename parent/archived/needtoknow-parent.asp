  <h3>Tip to Take Along:</h3>
  <p>Make  it a habit to use &ldquo;we&rdquo; language whenever possible. &ldquo;You versus us&rdquo; statements  set you in opposition to the rest of the team. By using language that includes  yourself as a part of the team you increase the likelihood that the school  will, too. </p>

<hr />
<h2 align="center">Who  Is On My Child&rsquo;s IEP Team?</h2>
<p>The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)  calls for a team of individuals, including parents and school personnel, to  work together to develop an Individual Educational Program (IEP) for a child  who qualifies for special education services. <br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  Because IEP decisions are made by a team rather than by  any one individual, it&rsquo;s important and helpful to understand the role of each  member. While each person brings a different set of experiences, concerns, and  skills to the table, you can expect that they all share a common goal: enabling  the child to succeed in school and in life.</p>
<h2 align="center">IEP Team Member of the  Month:<br />
  <span style="color:#3a6699">The Parent</span>*</h2>
<p>Long after the last teacher or therapist has disappeared from your child&rsquo;s  life, you will be there to support and encourage your child. Your active  participation as a member of his or her IEP team will help to ensure that your  child receives the education he or she needs and deserves.</p>
<p>Although parents are equal members on the IEP team, it&rsquo;s  not unusual to feel somewhat intimidated by all the professionals who outnumber  you at the meeting. It may be helpful to remember that your role is critically  important because of the following factors:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You are the expert on your child. Your in-depth,  ongoing relationship provides you with a wide-angle view of the child. &nbsp;Professionals often see the child through the  lens of their particular area of expertise. </li>

  <li>Parents are the only continuous members on a child&rsquo;s IEP team. You know  what has worked and what hasn&rsquo;t worked over time. You will be the one constant factor  through multiple transitions at school and in life. Professionals will change  from year to year.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The parent is the IEP team member who represents and advocates solely  for the individual child. School personnel are responsible for many children  and must be concerned with meeting all their needs. </li>

  <li>You are the keeper and communicator of high expectations for your  child. No one cares about your child&rsquo;s success as much as you do.</li>
</ul>
<p>To participate meaningfully and effectively as an  IEP team member, parents will want to carry out the following responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Read the notices, reports and documents the school provides. If you  don&rsquo;t understand something, ask for clarification. You may need to sign that  you agree or disagree with a proposed action. Whenever possible, complete and  return forms within requested timelines. </li>

  <li>Learn the basics of special education and the IEP process. Become  familiar with student and parent rights and school responsibilities. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Clearly communicate your family&rsquo;s goals and concerns for your child. Help  set priorities.</li>

  <li>Help your child to actively participate in the IEP process as much as  is appropriate. Ask them what is working well for them at school and what help  they need. Make sure they have the opportunity to communicate their interests,  concerns, strengths, and preferences. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>In meeting, keep the focus on your child.</li>

  <li>Become as informed as possible about your child&rsquo;s school program.&nbsp; Gather information, ask questions and when  possible, observe.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Listen to and consider other team member&rsquo;s input. The strength of a  team is the different perspectives each member brings. </li>

  <li>Monitor your child&rsquo;s progress on IEP goals and in the general  curriculum.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Provide feedback to the team. Alert the team to lack of progress or  other concerns. Celebrate successes and let people know when they are doing a  good job. Everyone likes to be on a winning team.</li>
</ul>
