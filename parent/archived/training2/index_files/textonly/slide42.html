        <p>Q: Can a surrogate parent be assigned to represent a student over the age of 18?</p>
        <p>A: In Minnesota students ages 18 through 21 are viewed as serving as their own parents. Therefore, if the student is able to make their own decisions, a surrogate would not be necessary. If the student is a ward of the state and it is appropriate, a surrogate may be assigned.</p>
        <p>Q: Are a surrogate parent's activities evaluated?</p>
        <p>A: Schools are responsible for monitoring the activities of each surrogate parent to make sure that he or she is fulfilling the duties as set forth by state and federal rules.</p>
        <p>Q: How often can a surrogate visit the child's classroom?</p>
        <p>A: A surrogate parent may visit the child's classroom as often as necessary to get to know the child and begin a profile of his or her needs and abilities as well as to monitor how the program is working. Check with the school about the procedures for visiting the classroom by contacting the teacher or principal. Make separate arrangements with any of the school's other staff who       may be serving your child. Do not interrupt       the teacher while you are observing.</p>
