<h2>Minnesota Statewide Assessment Testing</h2>

<p>All students in Minnesota, including students with disabilities, must take statewide assessments in certain academic areas.

These decisions are made by the IEP team which always includes the parents.</p>

<ul>
 <li>knowledge of statewide assessment options and statewide academic standards</li>
 <li>understanding of standards-based IEPs and participation in the general education curriculum</li>
 <li>how accommodations and modifications are determined</li>
 <li>ability to advocate for your child</li>
</ul>
<p>Having these skills will help you participate in IEP development for your child, especially in the area planning for involvement in statewide assessment.</p>
