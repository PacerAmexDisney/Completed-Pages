	<h2><strong>The 180 Race</strong></h2>
	<p>Goal: To encourage students to practice positively redirecting negative situations in a fun and engaging manner. </p>
<div class="materials">
  <h3>Materials: </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Enough space for all students to move quickly and safely. </li>
      <li>Stamps or stickers</li>
      <li>Print outs of various examples of bullying situations. </li>
    </ul>
</div>
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Divide students into groups of 3-4 people. Have each presenter stand at a &ldquo;station&rdquo;; make sure there is enough room around each station to avoid collisions. If you have more groups than presenters, make the groups bigger so that you have as many or more presenters as groups. </li>
      <li>Each station should have an example situation, a stamp or sticker for each group, and a presenter. Before beginning the activity, tell the students what order the stations go in to avoid collisions or conflict. </li>
      <li>With each group starting at a different station, have students go through all of the stations as quickly as (safely) possible. </li>
      <li>After a group finishes a station, they should look for an &ldquo;open&rdquo; station or stand in line for the next available station. </li>
      <li>When a group arrives at the station, the presenter should read the example situation aloud and then place it somewhere the group can see it. The group should then discuss and together come up with a way to &ldquo;turn a 180&rdquo; on the example situation. The presenter should make sure that students are working together; if one person shouts out an answer right away, tell them that they must discuss it with their group and come to a consensus before they get their reward. </li>
      <li>As soon as the group comes up with an acceptable answer and announces it to the presenter, the presenter should give them their stamp or sticker and send them to the next station. Remember, there is no &ldquo;right&rdquo; answer; in fact, presenters should encourage groups to be creative. However, there may be unacceptable answers. An acceptable answer will:
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Turn the situation in a positive direction </li>
        <li>Be respectful of all parties involved </li>
        <li>Be realistic </li>
      </ol>
      <li>The first group to receive a stamp or sticker from all stations wins. Presenters need not have any sort of prize. The satisfaction of winning should be enough. </li>
    </ol>
    <h4><strong>Example situations:</strong></h4>
      <p>Below are various examples of bullying situation you could use for this exercise. But remember, you are the experts! You are encouraged to come up with your own examples of bullying situation. Examples that are real and relevant to the current group will always be most effective. Remember, an effective example will be realistic and factual, but will make it clear that the bullying behavior in the example is unacceptable. </p>
    <p><strong>In the Nurse&rsquo;s Office</strong><br />
      Whenever Marci walks into her classroom, Jenna, Elizabeth, and Lindsey make whale noises at her. When they learned about the gravitational pull of planets in science class, Jenna got the whole class to pretend to be gravitating towards Marci. When Marci asked them to stop, they just laughed. Today Marci was so afraid to go to gym class with the three girls that she pretended to have a headache and hid in the nurse&rsquo;s office.</p>
  <p><strong>The New Jacket</strong><br />
      Michael got a new jacket for his birthday and was really pumped to wear it to school. When he walked up to Trent, however, Trent immediately started laughing and said &ldquo;Dude, you look so gay!&rdquo; Michael took off the jacket and stuffed it in his locker, but all day guys kept asking him where his gay coat was. He thought it would blow over by the next day&hellip;but it didn&rsquo;t. When Michael sat down at his usual lunch table, all the guys moved away, saying &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t want to catch the gay.&rdquo; After gym, Trent told him that he should go change in the girls&rsquo; locker room. This kind of stuff happened for the rest of the year.</p>
      <p><strong>Mocking in the Classroom</strong><br />
    When Ryan walks into his first period class, he finds that someone has written &ldquo;retard&rdquo; on his desk. He tries to ignore the word as he sits down but inside he feels awful. Like he does sometimes when he gets anxious, Ryan starts rocking back and forth. Across the room, a group of guys start mocking him, throwing their bodies violently back and forth and laughing at him. Ryan has tried to explain to them that he has Autism and sometimes he does things a little differently but they didn&rsquo;t listen to him. When this started at the beginning of the year, Ryan told his teacher who told him to ignore it and it would go away. Ryan&rsquo;s tried, but now it&rsquo;s spring and it&rsquo;s still happening. </p>
    <p><strong>Lying Texts</strong><br />
      You receive a text from a friend calling another classmate a slut, the latest in a long line of mean texts going around about this girl. You know the things being said about her aren&rsquo;t true and you feel bad because she&rsquo;s always been really nice to you. </p>
    <p><strong>Lonely Lunch </strong><br />
      At lunch, your friends are making fun of a classmate who, as usual, is sitting alone at the next table. Like they do every day, they&rsquo;re talking about him loudly enough for him to hear and start throwing bits of food at his table. You&rsquo;ve noticed that this classmate has been really down lately and you think something might have happened at home. </p>
    <p><strong>Gym Class Woes</strong><br />
      In gym class today everyone has to try and climb a knotted rope. One student has a really difficult time and the other students start taunting him, calling him names and mocking his attempts. You can tell that he&rsquo;s trying his hardest but the harassment is upsetting him and making it harder for him to climb. </p>
