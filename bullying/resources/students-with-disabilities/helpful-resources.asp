  <h3>Essay &mdash; The Short Bus Stops at My House</h3>
  <img src="/bullying/resources/images/laura-and-david.jpg" width="250" height="232" alt="laura and david" align="right" hspace="10" />
<p><em>Suggested Audience: Middle and high school students</em></p>
  <p>This essay, written by Laura, as an 18-year-old for her 17-year-old brother David, illustrates the powerful bond of siblings. It  illuminates the power and importance of language and how what we say and hear shapes our perceptions.</p>
    <p>Laura writes:</p>
    <p><em>It&rsquo;s funny how the length of the bus you ride has the ability to define you as a person. Personally, I rode the regular sized bus, the one the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; students rode to school. However, there was another bus that happened to stop at my house every weekday morning. The ...short bus, &quot;the retard racer&quot;, the bus that was transportation for my brother. Yes, my brother rode the short bus and will forever be the root of some kid&rsquo;s immature joke. Or even worse the root of some adult&rsquo;s joke. My brother is defined by his transportation of getting to school.</em></p>

    <p>After reading the essay, consider the following classroom discussion questions:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Why do people use condescending words about disabilities, such as &ldquo;retarded,&rdquo; to negatively reference a person or situation?</li>
    <li>What can be done to educate that it&rsquo;s not acceptable to use words that disparage people with disabilities?</li>
    <li>Do you think that education about the impact bullying has on students with disabilities would change anything?</li>
    <li>What would be helpful for parents and educators to know about how students with disabilities are treated at school and in the community?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Special thank you to Laura Hertzog for sharing her essay.</p>

  <h3>Video &mdash; Dare to Dream</h3>
  <p><em>Suggested Audience: Middle and high school students</em></p>
<p>Students with disabilities often express feelings of loneliness, misunderstanding, and powerlessness. But these students have found their voice, and they want to share their stories, and their dreams, with the world. Differences don’t have to divide us. They can serve as opportunities for discussion, diversity, and creativity – but only if we’re willing to listen.</p>

<h3>Handout &mdash; &ldquo;Person First&rdquo;<br />
  Recognizing the Person First, Then the Disability or Difference</h3>
  <p><em>Suggested Audience: Middle and high school students</em></p>
  <p>When someone seems different from you, it&rsquo;s pretty easy to focus on what sets them apart. Maybe it&rsquo;s how they look or speak. But think about it:</p>
  <p>Do differences define the person?<br />
  Suppose you were the only one who failed a math test.<br />
  Would you want to be called &ldquo;the math failure&rdquo;?<br />
  Wouldn&rsquo;t it be more accurate to say you were &ldquo;the person who failed the math test yesterday&rdquo;?<br />
  Your grade isn&rsquo;t who you are; it&rsquo;s one small thing about you.</p>
  <p>Every person is made up of many characteristics and abilities&mdash;but few people want to be identified only by those things. That&rsquo;s true whether it&rsquo;s their grade on a math test, their ability to play tennis, or their love for fried onions.</p>
 <p>Everyone is a person first.</p>
  <p>It&rsquo;s like that with disabilities, too. <a href="/bullying/resources/students-with-disabilities/pdf/person-first.pdf" target="_blank">Read more&gt;&gt;&gt;</a></p>

<h3>&ldquo;The Invisible Boy&rdquo; by Trudy Ludwig</h3>
<img src="/bullying/resources/images/invisible_boy_cover.jpg" width="150" height="187" alt="the invisible boy" align="right" hspace="10" />

<p><em>Suggested Audience: Elementary School</em>
 
<p>Meet Brian, the invisible boy. Nobody ever seems to notice him or think to include him in their group, game, or birthday party…until, that is, a new kid comes to class. When Justin, the new boy, arrives, Brian is the first to make him feel welcome. And when Brian and Justin team up to work on a class project together, Brian finds a way to shine. Author Trudy Ludwig shows how small acts of kindness can help children feel included and allow them to flourish.</p>
