	<h2 class="ExpandHeader">If Your Child Is Experiencing Bullying</h2>
<div style="width:200px; height:150px; float:left; margin:0 15px 20px"><img src="/bullying/resources/images/experiencing-bullying.jpg" width="200" height="150" alt=""/></div>
<p>When you discover your child is being bullied, you may feel a variety of emotions from anger to fear to sadness. These reactions and emotional responses are natural for parents who want their child to feel valued, protected, and loved. To become an effective advocate for your child, it is important to acknowledge your emotions and then focus on developing an action plan to help your child. 
<span class="ReadMore">Read More &hellip;</span>
</p>

<div class="ExpandItem">
<p>In thinking through your action plan, steps to consider might include:</p>
<p><strong>1. Talk with your child</strong>. <br />
  When you first talk with your child about bullying, be prepared to listen without judgment, and provide a safe and supportive place where your child can work out his or her feelings. Children may not be ready to open up right away as they, too, are dealing with the emotional effects of bullying and may be feeling insecure, frightened, vulnerable, angry, or sad. When your child begins to tell their story, just listen and avoid making judgmental comments. It&rsquo;s important to learn as much as possible about the situation, such as how long the behavior has been happening, who has been involved, and what steps have been taken. Encourage your child to talk, and let them know they are not alone and you are there to help.</p>
<p><strong>2. Support and empower your child. </strong><br />
  After hearing your child&rsquo;s story, empower them to create an action plan to help stop the bullying. Talk with your child about ways you can support them as well as intervention strategies they can use, such as working with the school or advocating on their own. Creating a plan that works with your child&rsquo;s strengths and abilities can help build self-confidence and resilience. Make sure to share these agreed-upon strategies with those involved in your child&rsquo;s life, such as teachers, coaches, and other adults who interact with your child on a daily basis.</p>
<p><strong>3. Learn your rights. </strong><br />
  Check your state&rsquo;s legislation on bullying. Each state has different laws and policies on bullying, along with requirements on how schools should respond. Visit <a href="http://www.stopbullying.gov" target="_blank">StopBullying.gov <span class="fa fa-external-link"></span></a> to find out the laws your state has put into place. Also, check your state&rsquo;s Department of Education website for a state Safe Schools office, which can be a great local resource to learn more about your state and school&rsquo;s policy. Another option is to look up your school&rsquo;s policy on bullying.</p>
<p><strong>4. Think through who else should be involved.</strong><br />
  In addition to being supportive and empowering your child to write down a plan, it can be very helpful to document the steps that you plan to take or have already implemented. Written records provide a history, which can be very helpful. You can also think through your strategy about how to involve others that can help your child. This might include determining who you will contact at school, what you plan to ask them, and how you will be involved. Other options include contacting a guidance counselor or other health professionals for advice. If the situation doesn&rsquo;t change, your plan might include steps to contact local law enforcement or legal counsel.</p>
<p><strong>5. Get involved in the community</strong>. <br />
  Bullying touches many lives and it might be happening to others in your child&rsquo;s school or community. You can help by raising awareness through community events, attending workshops or trainings in your community, or sharing information with others. </p>

<h2 class="ExpandHeader" style="clear:left">If Your Child with Disabilities Is Experiencing Bullying</h2>
<div style="width:200px; height:150px; float:left; margin:0 15px 20px"><img src="/bullying/resources/images/disabilities-experiencing-bullying.jpg" width="200" height="150" alt=""/></div>
<p>Studies have found that children with disabilities are two to three times more likely to be bullied than their nondisabled peers. Parents, educators, and other adults are the most important advocate that a student with disabilities can have and they play an important role in these bullying situations. As a parent of a student with disabilities, it&rsquo;s important to know about the federal laws and resources specifically designed for your child&rsquo;s situation. 
<span class="ReadMore">Read More &hellip;</span>
</p>
<div class="ExpandItem">
<p>The Individualized Education Program (IEP) can be a helpful tool in developing a bullying prevention plan for students with disabilities. Remember, every child receiving special education is entitled to a free, appropriate public education (FAPE), and bullying can sometimes become an obstacle to receiving that education. The IEP team, which includes the parent, can identify strategies that can be written into the IEP to help stop bullying. When appropriate, it may be helpful to involve the child in this decision-making process.</p>
<p>Parents have legal rights when their child with a disability is the target of bullying or disability harassment. According to a 2000 Dear Colleague Letter from the Office of Civil Rights, &ldquo;States and school districts also have a responsibility&hellip;to ensure that a free appropriate public education (FAPE) is made available to eligible students with disabilities. Disability harassment may result in a denial of FAPE under these statutes.&rdquo; Under these federal laws, schools are required to respond to harassment or bullying of a student with a disability. The school must provide immediate and appropriate action to investigate, communicate with targeted students regarding steps to end harassment, eliminate any hostile environment, and prevent harassment from recurring. If the school is not taking necessary action, parents may consider filing a formal grievance with the Office of Civil Rights.</p>

<h2 class="ExpandHeader" style="clear:left">If Your Child Shows Bullying Behavior</h2>

<p>Many parents are surprised to learn that their child is showing bullying behavior. Often, they have no idea that their child is exhibiting these behaviors. If you find out your child or student is bullying, it&rsquo;s important to know that bullying is a behavior and that behavior can be changed. Students bully for many reasons, including peer pressure or being bullied themselves. Your child may not realize how much he or she is harming someone, what impact their actions are having on another child, or may not label their behavior as bullying. 
<span class="ReadMore">Read More &hellip;</span>
</p>

<div class="ExpandItem">

<p>The first step is to talk with your child about why he or she is showing the behavior. This conversation should allow your child to explore how they may be feeling, to speak up if they are being bullied by someone else, and to talk about other factors that may be leading to this behavior. Try to understand your child&rsquo;s feelings and show that you hear what they are telling you. Help your child understand how others feel when they are bullied and let them know that everyone has feelings that matter. Role playing can be helpful to teach your child or student different ways of handling situations, along with helping them understand how their behavior is impacting someone else.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to be realistic as it takes time to change behavior. Be patient with your child as they learn new ways of handling feelings and conflict. Provide praise and recognition when your child handles conflict well or finds a positive way to deal with their feelings. This type of positive reinforcement goes a long way! </p>

<p>Nearly 60 percent of bullying situations end when a peer intervenes, giving students an important role in bullying prevention. However, many students are unsure how to take the first step. As a parent, it&rsquo;s important to have the discussion with kids and teens about the power they have to help others. 
<span class="ReadMore">Read More &hellip;</span>
</p>

<div class="ExpandItem">

<p>The simplest action parents can tell students to take is not to join in. This sends the message that they don&rsquo;t agree with what&rsquo;s happening and takes attention away from the person bullying. Students can also help by telling an adult about the bullying, since the student who is being bullied might not be able to do it themselves. With this action, it is important to discuss the difference between telling and tattling. Telling is done to protect yourself or another student from getting hurt, whereas tattling is done to purposely get someone in trouble.</p>
<p>Finally, the most effective step to encourage your child or student to take is to show support for the student being bullied. Ask your student how they would feel if they were being bullied, and how they would want someone to support them. They can show support by talking to the student being bullied, telling them what happened isn&rsquo;t okay, or inviting the student to join them in an activity. With lots of options, encourage your child to do what feels right for them. </p>
