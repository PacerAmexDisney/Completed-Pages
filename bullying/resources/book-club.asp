May in 1939.</p>

One particularly stormy Christmas Eve, Rudolph manages to prove himself after Santa Claus catches sight of his nose and asks him to lead his sleigh for the evening. Rudolph agrees, saving Christmas, and is finally treated the way he deserves by his fellow reindeer!</p>

                    <p>It's only the first day of school for Dexter, but he's already mad at the principal, and the secretary, and the janitor, and the kids who laugh at him. When his teacher tells the class to write a story, Dexter writes about how tough he is -- and how he's already gotten into a fight. Is any of Dexter's story true? Why was the other boy crying before Dexter hit him? And why would the other boy still want to be Dexter's friend?</p>
                    <p>Even Dexter doesn't know the answers to some of those questions. But as he deals with family problems, a persistent teacher, and a boy who's strangely interested in floor wax, he discovers many surprises hidden in his own tale.</p>

                    <p>Mexico may be her parents&rsquo; home, but it&rsquo;s certainly not Margie&rsquo;s. She has finally convinced the other kids at school she is one-hundred percent American&mdash;just like them. But when her Mexican cousin Lupe visits, the image she&rsquo;s created for herself crumbles.</p>
                    <p>Things aren&rsquo;t easy for Lupe, either. Mexico hadn&rsquo;t felt like home since her father went North to find work. Lupe&rsquo;s hope of seeing him in the United States comforts her some, but learning a new language in a new school is tough. Lupe, as much as Margie, is in need of a friend.</p>
                    <p>Little by little, the girls&rsquo; individual steps find the rhythm of one shared dance, and they learn what &ldquo;home&rdquo; really means. In the tradition of My Name is Maria Isabel&mdash;and simultaneously published in English and in Spanish&mdash;Alma Flor Ada and her son Gabriel M. Zubizarreta offer an honest story of family, friendship, and the classic immigrant experience: becoming part of something new, while straying true to who you are.</p>

                    <p>Maggie hates how Elizabeth acts so much better than everyone else. Besides, she&rsquo;s always covered in dog hair. And she smells. So Maggie creates a fake profile on a popular social networking site to teach Elizabeth a lesson.</p>

								<p>The heartwarming story of a misunderstood pit bull and a very shy little girl named Reny. Together, with the help of friends, family, and a goofy pack of mixed breed dogs, they confront and overcome the challenges of being misjudged and bullied. </p>
                                <p>The adventure begins when Lance is adopted by Reny's family and must learn to be an &quot;inside dog.&quot; He and the quiet little girl become buddies when Lance tries to help Reny overcome her anxiety about school where she is being teased and bullied. However, it quickly becomes apparent that Lance has problems of his own. Big, black and tough-looking, Lance often frightens people who don't know him. He is thrust into the limelight of a bigger problem when Mrs. Krutch, a grown-up who bullies, introduces a law to ban pit bulls from the town.</p>
                                <p>It takes a petition signing campaign, an appearance at city hall by everyone involved, and an act of courage by Reny to defeat the proposed law. In the end, it is Reny's ability to lead with her heart and speak her truth that overcomes Mrs. Krutch's fear and reminds everyone not to judge a book by its cover.</p>

								<p>A touching, inspirational story targeted for 5- to 11-year-olds, My Secret Bully instantly draws young readers into Monica's world where she is bullied by a friend and learns how to cope and thrive. Relational aggression is an act of emotional bullying hidden among tightly knit networks of friends. Instead of using knives and fists to bully others, emotional bullies employ relationships, words, and gestures as their weapons of attack. Emotional bullying is often dismissed as a normal rite of passage, but research shows it is as harmful as physical aggression, with devastating, long-term effects.</p>
								<p>Name-calling, humiliation, exclusion, and manipulation are some bullying tactics Monica's friend Katie employs. Monica learns to face her fears of betrayal and social isolation and reclaims her power from the bully with the help of a supportive adult - her mother. Included in this wonderful resource for children, parents, teachers, and counselors are helpful tips, discussion questions, and additional information.</p>

								<p>These three books tell the story of an ongoing case of bullying from three third graders’ perspectives. Luisa describes being targeted by bullying in <em>Weird!</em> Jayla shares her experience as a bystander to bullying in <em>Dare!</em> And in <em>Tough!</em>, Sam speaks from the point of view of someone initiating bullying. Kids will easily relate to Luisa, Jayla, and Sam, as each girl has her own unique experience, eventually learning how to face her challenges with the help of friends, peers, and caring adults.</p>
								<p>The books may be read separately or as a set; readers will enjoy tracking small details that carry over from one book to another. These books on bullying each conclude with “activity club” pages for kids, as well as information to help parents, teachers, counselors, and other adults reinforce the books’ messages and foster dialogue with children.</p>

								<p>August Pullman was born with a facial deformity that, up until now, has prevented him from going to a mainstream school. Starting 5th grade at Beecher Prep, he wants nothing more than to be treated as an ordinary kid—but his new classmates can't get past Auggie's extraordinary face. <em>Wonder</em> by R.J. Palacio begins from Auggie's point of view, but soon switches to include his classmates, his sister, her boyfriend, and others. These perspectives converge in a portrait of one community's struggle with empathy, compassion, and acceptance. In a world where bullying among young people is an epidemic, this is a refreshing new narrative full of heart and hope. R.J. Palacio has called her debut novel "a meditation on kindness"—indeed, every reader will come away with a greater appreciation for the simple courage of friendship. Auggie is a hero to root for, a diamond in the rough who proves that you can’t blend in when you were born to stand out.</p>
