	<h3 style="text-align:center">More than a decade together against bullying-and united for kindness, acceptance and inclusion.</h3>
    <p>National Bullying Prevention Month is a campaign in the United States founded in 2006 by PACER's National Bullying Prevention Center. The campaign is held during the month of October and unites communities nationwide to educate and raise awareness of bullying prevention. Initially held the first week in October, the event was expanded in 2010 to the entire month.</p>
    
    <p>PACER developed the initial campaign, National Bullying Prevention and Awareness Week, to raise awareness about bullying.  Historically, bullying had been viewed as &ldquo;a childhood rite of passage&rdquo; that &ldquo;made kids tougher,&rdquo; but the reality has always been that bullying can leave devastating and often long-term effects such as a loss of self-esteem, increased anxiety, and depression for those involved.  PACER reached out to the community through partnerships with education-based organizations such as the National PTA, the American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association to provide schools, parents and students with the educational resources and support to better respond to bullying behavior.  The National Bullying Prevention Center laid the groundwork so that National Bullying Prevention Month is now a nationwide call to action around educating communities as to their roles in bullying prevention.  This initiative has helped shift thinking away from bullying as &ldquo;rite of passage&rdquo; and toward the knowledge that bullying can be prevented and stopped through education and awareness.</p>
    
    <p>National Bullying Prevention Month is recognized in communities across the United States, with hundreds of schools and organizations signing on as partners. Facebook, Disney, Instagram, CNN, TLC and Yahoo! Kids and many others have supported the month through media outreach and dissemination.</p>

    <h3>2006, Oct. 22 - 28 | National Bullying Prevention Awareness Week Empowers Schools, Parents to End Childhood Harassment</h3>
    <p>National Bullying Prevention Awareness Week was held Oct. 22 - 28, 2006. It is sponsored by PACER Center and cosponsored by National PTA, National Coalition for Parent Involvement in Education, and National Education Association. Teachers, parents, and children nationwide were encouraged to use bullying prevention activities and materials at PACER's interactive, animated website for elementary school students to help end bullying.</p>
    <p>&quot;Childhood bullying is a significant problem nationwide,&quot; said Paula F. Goldberg, executive director of PACER, a national parent center located in Minnesota. &quot;It can cause school absenteeism, mental and physical stress, poor school performance, poor self-esteem, and, in some cases, school violence. Statistics show that 160,000 children in the United States miss school each day as a result of being bullied. That's not acceptable. &quot;Teachers and parents can play a critical role in creating a climate where bullying is not tolerated. When adults and children stand together, bullying ends,&quot; Goldberg said.</p>
