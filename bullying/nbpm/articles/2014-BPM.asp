		<p>In October 2014, From New York to New Zealand, thousands of schools, communities, organizations, and individuals came together during PACER’s National Bullying Prevention Month to raise awareness for bullying prevention. It was the largest demonstration of support for students who have been bullied since PACER initiated the campaign in 2006.</p>

  <p>“National Bullying Prevention Month has grown more than we could have ever expected,” said Paula Goldberg, PACER’s executive director. “In less than 10 years, PACER has helped to create a global bullying prevention movement with millions of supporters. We know it is making a positive difference for children and families.”</p>
    <h3>Unity Day celebrated worldwide</h3>
    <p>On Unity Day, Oct. 22, PACER’s National Bullying Prevention Month reached its pinnacle when students, educators, families, TV personalities, and others wore orange, held events, and shared stories, photos, videos, and more on social media. In Mexico, a middle school held the first international Run, Walk, Roll Against Bullying event; students in New Zealand decorated bullying prevention cookies; and a school in Taiwan displayed Unity Day posters.</p>
    <p>PACER’s campaign was also supported by corporations including: CustomInk, Disney, Facebook, Frito-Lay, Galderma, Green Giant, and the TLC network. Disney employees in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Argentina honored Unity Day in a variety of ways, from wearing orange to dedicating acts of kindness to each other. Australian motivational speaker, author, and PACER partner Nick Vujicic, who was born without arms and legs, held a press conference in Mexico and posted videos for his millions of followers on Facebook. “We are thrilled by the outpouring of support for Unity Day,” said Julie Hertzog, director of PACER’s National Bullying Prevention Center. “It was amazing and inspiring to see everyone unite to spread an important message of hope.”</p>
    <p>More than 400 people participated in PACER’s fifth annual Run, Walk, Roll Against Bullying presented by American Dairy Queen in Bloomington, Minn. on Sept. 20. U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar spoke and students from local schools shared messages of inclusion and kindness.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In Culver, Ind., local businesses hung Unity Day banners and painted their windows with bullying prevention messages. At schools, inspirational messages were posted on every locker.</li>
      <li>At Incarnate Word Academy in Corpus Christi, Texas, students celebrated Unity by wearing orange shirts, placing orange ribbons on locker handles, and participating in bullying prevention activities in the classroom.</li>
      <li>Nearly 500 students and school staff in Hilbert, Wis., showed their commitment by standing together in a gymnasium to spell a giant human U-N-I-T-Y, and doing a district-wide Unity Dance.</li>
