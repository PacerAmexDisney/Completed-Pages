Whether you are a student, educator, or parent, here are important points to know and emphasize when you speak in front of a group, lead a class discussion, or talk with peers.</p>
<h2 class="hr"><strong>National  Bullying Prevention Month Key Messages</strong></h2>
<ul>

  <li>Provide Education: Anyone can access the free web-based resources that can be used by schools, parents, and students to promote bullying prevention. Activities include interactive websites, classroom toolkits, letter-writing campaigns, contests, live events, and much more!</li>
  <li>Inspire Action: There is something for everyone. Educators can access the free toolkits for student-led activities and downloadable posters and other visual displays, as well as bookmarks and other promotional items. Parents can visit the websites with their children. Communities can participate in Unity Day or Run, Walk, Roll Against Bullying events.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="hr"><strong>Bullying  Prevention and Awareness Facts</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>The time is now to recognize that bullying has gone on too long, and too many have suffered as a result.</li>
  <li>More than one out of every five students will be bullied this year, chances are this is happening to someone you know and care about.</li>
  <li>Bullying is a communitywide issue that must no longer be ignored or thought of as a rite of passage.</li>
  <li>Every child has the right to feel safe and supported.</li>
  <li>Bullying directly affects a student&rsquo;s ability to learn. Students who are bullied often do not want to go to school. They often find it difficult to concentrate, show a decline in grades, and lose self-esteem, self-confidence, and self-worth.</li>
  <li>Students who are bullied report more physical symptoms, such as headaches or stomachaches, and mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety, than other students.</li>
  <li>In some cases, bullying has led to devastating consequences, such as school shootings and suicide.</li>
  <li>Bullying affects witnesses as well as targets. Witnesses often report feeling unsafe, helpless, and afraid that they will be the next target.</li>
  <li>Students who bully can also be negatively affected, showing higher rates of physical and emotional health issues.</li>
  <li>Bullying is not only devastating while it&rsquo;s happening, research shows that the negative effects last a lifetime.</li>
  <li>Students can be especially effective in bullying intervention. More than 55 percent of bullying situations will stop when a peer intervenes. Student education of how to address bullying for peers is critical, as is the support of adults.</li>
  <li>Silence is no longer an acceptable response to bullying. Adults, students, and educators can no longer look away when they see bullying. Ignoring it won&rsquo;t work. Everyone needs to be empowered with options to respond.</li>
</ul>
