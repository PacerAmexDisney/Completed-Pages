				<h2>1. Hold an Event</h2>
				<p>As a community, you can create  social change so that bullying is no longer an accepted childhood rite of  passage. Begin to make a difference by holding an event in your community to  raise awareness about bullying. The event can be a community petition signing,  a run or walk against bullying, a fundraiser, or anything that shows your  community cares about this important issue. Reach out to local businesses for  sponsorship or donations. The event can include music, giveaways, special  speakers and more as your community shows they are together against bullying and united for  kindness, acceptance, and inclusion. Bullying prevention is a community issue,  and it takes all of us to create change!</p>
<h2>2. Celebrate Unity Day as a Community</h2>
				<p>Make it orange and make it end! If you care about safe and supportive communities and schools, wear orange on Unity Day. That’s the day when everyone can come together—in schools, communities, and online—to send one large message of kindness, acceptance and inclusion. By wearing orange on Unity Day, your community can show students who may be experiencing bullying that they are not alone. Communities can participate by wearing orange, signing an orange &ldquo;Unite Against Bullying&rdquo; banner, distributing orange unity ribbons, ordering a Unity Day poster or t-shirt from PACER, or other creative ideas that involve the color orange.</p>
				<h2>3. Work Together</h2>
				<p>Bullying doesn&rsquo;t just happen at  school. It can happen at the park, bus stop, online, or within a sports team or  community group. It&rsquo;s important for all community members to be aware of  bullying behaviors and take action if they see it happening. All kids deserve  to be safe. By working together to reinforce respectful and kind behaviors, a  community can create a positive and safe climate for all students.</p>
<h2>4. Spread the Word About Bullying Prevention</h2>
				<ul>
				<li>Begin raising awareness about bullying by spreading the word within your community! Make bullying prevention a movement that touches everyone. This can be done by sharing information about a local event with newspapers or online publications, posting on social media channels, or just connecting with someone in person.</li>
				<li>Everyone has a voice in raising awareness about bullying. Speak about the important issue in front of a group, as a community discussion, or with peers and colleagues. Share that bullying has a lifelong impact, and provide people the tools to respond effectively, such as ways to get involved with your community’s bullying prevention events and efforts.</li>
				</ul>			
				
				<h2>5. Request a governor's Proclamation</h2>
				<ul>
				<li>Promote bullying prevention in your state! Contact your governor’s office and ask how to submit a request for a governor’s proclamation for National Bullying Prevention  Month in October. Schools, students, parents, organizations, and others can submit requests. <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/nbpm/spreadtheword/governors-proclamation.asp">Download PACER's sample proclamation</a>, fill in the sample text with your state’s information, and submit it. Easy as that!</li>
				<li>With this proclamation, your state will be recognizing the hurtful effects of bullying and encouraging other communities to get involved with National Bullying Prevention Month in October.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Bullying is a community-wide issue  that must no longer be ignored or thought of as a rite of passage. Students,  parents, and educators all have a role in addressing bullying situations and changing  school and community culture.</p></div>
