	<p>Lesson 2: Individuality &ndash; Respecting differences and everyone&rsquo;s right to be who they are.</p>
	<p>Lesson 3: Being There &ndash; Learning ways in which students can reach out to their peers.</p>
	<p>Lesson 4: Build Them Up &ndash; Sharing ideas about how students can show that everyone matters.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center">Goals of the WE WILL GENERATION</h3>
    <ul>
	<li>Broaden and refine students&rsquo; understanding of bullying.</li>
	<li>Provide a framework for students to internalize the right to individuality and an understanding of differences.</li>
	<li>Create an environment in which students feel educated, inspired, and supported to take action to build an inclusive culture.</li>
	 <li>Help all students recognize and develop positive strategies to respond to bullying situations.</li>
    </ul>

<h3 style="text-align:center">Messages of the WE WILL GENERATION</h3>

	  <p><strong>Respect Differences</strong> &ndash; Each student has the right to their individuality. Through differences we are stronger.</p>
      <p><strong>Unite Together</strong> &ndash; When we stand together we are stronger than when we stand alone. Our common bond is that we all have something to offer.</p>
      <p><strong>Take Action</strong> &ndash; There are opportunities to help those who are struggling. There is power in kindness and building people up.</p>

          <h3 style="text-align:center">Safe and Supportive School Climate</h3>
     <p> A student-to-student program is one element of a successful plan to address bullying. A student focused program should be supported with other initiatives that include:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>school-wide assessment of bullying</li>
      <li>development and distribution of bullying prevention policies and rules</li>
      <li>engage, educate and involve parents</li>
      <li>building bullying prevention activities into school curriculum</li>
      <li>educator and school-personnel training and support</li>
      <li>strategies to support students involved in bullying situations</li>
    </ul>
