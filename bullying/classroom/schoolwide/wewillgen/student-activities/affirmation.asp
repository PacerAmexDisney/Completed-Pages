	<h2>Affirmation</h2>
	<p>Goal: Encourage students to practice building each other up in meaningful ways. </p>
<div class="materials">
  <h3>Materials: </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Sheet of paper and writing utensil for each student</li>
      <li>Optional: Camera</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
      <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Tell students that you&rsquo;re going to practice building each other up with words. Have everyone sit in a circle, including the teacher and facilitators if they are known to the group. </li>
      <li>Hand out a sheet of paper and a pen/pencil to each person. Instruct them to write their own name clearly at the very bottom of the paper. </li>
      <li>Have everyone pass their paper to the person sitting to their left. This person will write down a strength of the person at the TOP of the page. Be sure to remind students to focus on something the person does or something about their personality, not their appearance. Examples might include:
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Jordan is an awesome guitar player. </li>
        <li>Tanya is super good at basketball.</li>
        <li>Carla can always make people smile. </li>
      </ol>
      <li>After everyone has finished writing, instruct the students to fold the paper over just enough so that their comment isn&rsquo;t visible. Pass the paper to the next person.</li>
      <li>Repeat steps 8 and 9 until everyone has their own paper back. Give everyone sufficient time to read through their page. Then ask them to choose their favorite and share it with the group. This way, students not only get a chance to practice building each other up, but they also have a chance to celebrate their own accomplishments.</li>
      <li>Remind students that while these actions can be particularly effective when directed at targets of bullying, they don&rsquo;t have to wait for bullying to happen to practice. Challenge the group to do one thing to build each other up every day. </li>
    </ol>

      <p><strong>Option</strong>: If you have a lot of time or want to make a more visual impact, have each student sit in front of a whiteboard or blackboard. Have the other students each come up and write a positive thing about the student on the board behind them. Don&rsquo;t let the student peek at what&rsquo;s being written! Take a picture and give it to the student. </p>
