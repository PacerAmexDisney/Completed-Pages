				<p>What is bullying? Bullying is all about power, and one person or group of people using their power—whether it’s physical strength, popularity or sharing embarrassing photos or information—to control or harm someone else. It can take place in person or online. Unfortunately, bullying is a fact of life for many kids and teens; research suggests almost half of teens have experienced bullying while on-line or over their cell phone in the past year.</p>

					<h3>“Stand Together” by Hayley Reardon</h3>

				<p>Show the 4 minute video, &ldquo;Stand Together&rdquo; by Hayley Reardon<br />
					Hayley writes, <em>&ldquo;Think about the amount of time we spend at home with our families versus in school with our classmates. Whether we like it or not, school is a big part of our lives and we&rsquo;re all here because we have to be. Growing up is hard for each of us in different ways but would be easier on everyone if we could face our time together as a team. Not a divided or broken team but a team who understands that we all have our own strengths and weaknesses and something to contribute. Ultimately, the only question we need to ask ourselves is what stops us from having each other&rsquo;s backs and choosing to stand together.&rdquo;</em> <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/classroom/middle-highschool/student/hayley-reardon-music.asp" target="_blank">Listen to more of Hayley&rsquo;s music&gt;&gt;&gt;</a><br />

				<ul>
					<li>Think back and remember that stage when we were all of a sudden “too cool” for the things that used to make us happy. What parts of ourselves do we start to lose track of as we try to grow up?</li>
					<li>How can we identify the people around us that are struggling with bullying?</li>
					<li>What can we do to make them feel less alone?</li>
					<li>Do you think adults sometimes forget or not understand what it’s like to be young? We know better than anyone how and where bullying occurs and probably have the best ideas on how to stop it.</li>
