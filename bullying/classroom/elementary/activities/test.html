                            told that they are not good enough. To show them that no matter how awful people make you feel, how hopeless life may seem, things do get better; and many others have been in your shoes. If you believe in yourself, that's
                            all you need and with that, anything is possible.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/stories/student-action/events/2017-grace-rembinski.asp">Read more &gt;&gt;&gt;</a></p>

                        <p>As a young girl, Haley Bird was diagnosed with a severe peanut allergy. She could not touch, breathe, or be in the same room with peanuts. As a result, she grew up knowing what she could and could not eat. As Haley got
                            older, things began to get more difficult. Her peers would tease, call her names, and even wave candy in her face. Teachers would hang-up signs in the classroom to show that no peanuts were allowed, which made her even
                            more of a target. When the bullying got worse, Haley&rsquo;s parents met with her school to implement a 504 plan to insure she was safe on school grounds. </p>
                        <p>&ldquo;I always knew I was different and faced many obstacles because of my food allergy,&rdquo; says Haley. &ldquo;However, I am fortunate that my parents have been so supportive of the issues regarding my food allergy, as
                            well as my experiences being a target of bullying because of it.  That is why it is so important to tell someone you trust if you are being bullied or if you witness bullying behavior.&rdquo;<br/>
                        </p>
                        <p>For these reasons, Haley, now Miss Arkansas International 2017, chose the platform of &ldquo;Bully Free Starts with Me.&rdquo; She is educating young children to know where to turn if they are being bullied and to not let
                            the words, actions, or ignorance of others defeat them. She is sharing this message with as many people as she can, including Arkansas state senators, representatives, and the governor who care so much about bully
                            prevention. &ldquo;I am working as a voice with them,&rdquo; says Haley. </p>
                        <p>&ldquo;No matter what people say to you it does not define the person you are. Yes, I was bullied in school, but I now use my story to empower those around me. If we all foster love, I believe that bullying will eventually
                            end. One word or action can change a person&rsquo;s life. Stand up for those around you.&rdquo;</p>

                        <p>Gabriella Aguirre is a junior in high school, and is currently Miss Southeast Iowa's Outstanding Teen for 2017. She is exceptionally enthusiastic about dancing, singing, and playing the piano, along with possessing a

                        <p>Gabriella first experienced bullying in middle school, where she was one of 16 students. Due to small class sizes, finding friends that she had things in common with was difficult. She felt isolated from both her peers and
                            teachers because they did not agree with her beliefs. Therefore, Gabriella turned to one of her many passions, dance, to explore new friendships. Unfortunately, she was then bullied by the person she least expected. <a

                        <p>I was first bullied in first grade. I was told I was stupid and fat. I was hit. In school there was a group of girls that would gang up on me. I knew then that I had to do something about this problem. After weeks of name
                            calling and comments I finally went to my parents. In 2009 I started G.A.B. Girls. I was only 9, so I knew I needed help; to not only help my friends and myself but other children. Together my mom and I brainstormed what
                            we wanted our support group to stand for. We came up with G.A.B. Girls (Girls Against Bullying Girls). Mom had me research and read about bullying, as well as abusive behavior, so I could learn to help others and help me
                            understand why some people could be cruel. My parents set up a Facebook and website. Mom ordered bracelets and t-shirts. I answer all my own email from girls asking for advice or moms wanting to help their kids. We just
                            started doing workshops two years ago. I really enjoy doing them and know that I am making a difference. My website is <a href="http://gabgirls.wix.com/gabgirls" target="_blank">gabgirls.wix.com/gabgirls</a>. </p>
                        <p>My workshops help teach others about anti bullying, building self-confidence, and working together to make a difference. In my workshops I use my 5 step plan B.R.A.V.E. I also teach them to tell the bully to stop, walk away
                            from the bully, tell an adult that they trust, and never fight back with the bully. Last year I went to Atlanta, Georgia to speak about G.A.B at Kids are Heroes. I really enjoyed it because I was able to meet kids from all
                            over the world who have their own passion to make a positive difference. I also had so many people come to me and tell me their story about when they were being picked on by another. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            We all need to all stand up if we see bullying going on and we need to take a stand to do what is right, to make a positive difference in our community. Here is my advice,&quot;don’t be a bystander on anything.&quot; If
                            you see someone being mean or doing something wrong, SAY SOMETHING. Think how you would feel if you were in that victim’s shoes and were all by yourself. Get involved in your community and school. Find trusted adults and
                            ask for their support. Start a support group or just volunteer to a cause that is important to you. It can be something as simple as offering to help pick up sticks in an older person’s yard.</p></td>

                            Bullying Prevention Center and was granted permission to produce a Public Service Announcement entitled “Hear the Silence” for my Girl Scout Gold Award. The goal was to get a perspective of a mother and daughter, as well
                            as the viewpoint of someone who had bullied. I discovered in my interviews that several years ago, I was a participant of bullying and wanted to interweave my personal experience into the story. I hoped to bring attention
                            from all angles of bullying and hope my story will help others combat peer pressure, to recognize if they are being bullied, and to get help.</p>
                        <p>I discovered a lot about myself, and how we all struggle with finding our voice and learning how to be strong and empowered. I apologized to the mother and daughter and we remain good friends. My advice, reach out and speak
                            out so you can be part of the solution, not the problem. To quote Alexander Pope, to err, is human but to forgive, is divine!</p>

                            someone cared about them. So he started an initiative called SEW for SOS, where students spend some of the recess periods sewing miniature pillows with inspirational messages stuffed inside. Then they send these pillows to
                            people they believe need support – patients, veterans, and other students.</p>
                        <p>Luke writes, &ldquo;It is important to me because I want to express the fact that even though I am a kid, that I can make a positive change in my community. That desire to make a difference even at a young age is what
                            pushes me to work extremely hard every day.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>Luke and the other members of SEW for SOS are living proof that you’re never too young to make a difference in your community!</p>

                        <p>In May 2014, the students of <a href="http://www.visitation.net/page.cfm?p=520" target="_blank">VISTA Productions</a> (the joint theater program of Visitation School and Saint Thomas Academy) put on Shrek The Musical! This
                            vibrant, exciting show includes powerful bullying prevention messages such as embracing differences and being proud of who you are. The VISTA students collaborated with PACER to create a project that linked the show with
                            bullying prevention themes. The students made an effort to really understand the issue and were deeply motivated to make a difference in their school. They created a beautiful display that celebrated the unique
                            characteristics of the cast and crew; it declared “What makes us special makes us strong!” Bullying is an issue that affects students on a deeply personal level, but it has important implications for parents, teachers,
                            schools, and communities as well.</p>
                        <p>One student writes, “Working with PACER added a depth to Shrek. It isn't just a show that made me laugh, it's a show that made me consider what it means to be comfortable with the 'fairy tale creature' I am, and not the
                            manufactured citizen of Duloc that society asks me to be.”</p>
                        <p>Bullying prevention is a community effort, and the students of VISTA Productions have shown their compassion, talent, and creativity through this project.</p>

                            had gone through the same thing. I soon realized that the problem was much bigger than my school. I have always had a passion for helping others and bullying stands out the most to me, which made my desire to help not only
                            my friend but girls everywhere. I want to inspire girls to be more positive not only on social media, but also through the interactions they have face to face. I want Love Share Care to be a social place that gives girls
                            the freedom to share their ups and downs without the fear of being teased or bullied. I hope that my efforts show girls all over the world that we can make a difference by doing kind things for others, no matter how old

                        <p>First-grader Jhorielle learned about bullying during a Town Hall meeting at her school. She immediately went home and drew a picture that invited her friends to sign up to stop bullying with her. With her mom’s help, she
                            made a website to encourage other kids to stop bullying and started handing out pencils and stickers to spread her message. She says that she made the website because she “wants every child to know how to stop bullying and
                            to learn how to be nice instead of being mean.” <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/stories/student-action/events/2013-By-Jhorielle.asp">Read more.</a></p></td>

                            bullying behavior. At our school, Pima Elementary in Scottsdale, AZ, we recognize that many people are challenged by bullying everyday and sometimes they just need a little help. By being a better bystander, we can raise
                            the expectations for behavior at school, in our community, and become positive influences for one another on a regular basis. <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/stories/student-action/events/2013-KeepYourEyesOpen.asp">Read more</a></p>

                        <p>&ldquo;Yore Story&rdquo; is a documentary that has been in the works for over a year now. The film was produced by Illinois State University students. It addresses the issue of bullying in schools and online, and the
                            traumatic effects in can have on kids and their families, by remembering the tragic story of Jessica Yore. Jessica Yore was a local high school student from Waukegan, who chose to take her own life two years ago because
                            she felt she had no other way out. Perhaps even just as tragic as her suicide itself, was how preventable it was, and the lack of reaction to it. This kind of cruelty should never be tolerated, and something like this
                            should never have to happen to anyone else ever again. This documentary explores the issues of bullying by remembering a beautiful life. We will be premiering the documentary on Saturday, July 20th at 7pm. The location is
                            Jack Benny Center for the Arts, located at 39 Jack Benny Dr. in Waukegan Il, 60085. $5 donations will be collected at the door and all proceeds will go towards &ldquo;PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention
