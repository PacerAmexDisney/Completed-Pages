<h3>Post Play Discussion</h3>
<p>
Students can benefit from group discussion about the how the bullying scenario was handled in the play and by brainstorming other methods to handle the situation. Questions for the group could include:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>What was the bullying scenario in the play?</li>
	<li>Who was involved in intervening in the situation? What did they do?</li>
	<li>What are other options for handling the situation?</li>
</ul>
<p>
In discussing options, it is important to note that students often will decide on &#8220;direct confrontation,&#8221; such as telling the person bullying &#8220;to stop.&#8221; This can be effective, but for many students, is the most difficult to implement. Encourage students to reflect on indirect options&#8212;such as asking the other student to play or telling them &#8220;that no one deserves to be bullied.&#8221;

    <em>&quot;I am the mother of an adult son with autism. Over the years, he has been the victim of teasing and bullying many times. Thanks to the efforts of his champions: his second grade teacher-who taught his classmates to be human, his older brother- who taught him how to be a &quot;guy&quot;, and his father-who is his biggest fan-he has been able to rise above those incidents. My many years of teaching have given me tremendous faith in kids-talk to them honestly, and they will listen. They are the ones who can stop bullying in its tracks. I  also believe in the power of theatre to change people. I hope that these scripts will give teachers a place to begin discussion and also a fun classroom activity.&quot; Barb</em></p>
