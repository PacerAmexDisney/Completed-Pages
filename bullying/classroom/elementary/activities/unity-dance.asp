<p><strong>Dance to make a statement against bullying!</strong></p>
<p>Dance, unite&mdash;and make a statement against bullying&mdash;by holding a Unity Dance. Join schools, students, and community organizations around the world to unite with PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center in music and dance to bring awareness to bullying prevention.</p>
<p>The song selected for the event is &ldquo;<strong>You Can&rsquo;t Take That Away From Me</strong>,&rdquo; which was created by Nashville songwriters <strong>Tim Akers </strong>and<strong> Libby Weaver</strong>. Akers, the father of a child with a disability, has seen firsthand the struggles and frustrations that some children deal with because they are viewed as &ldquo;different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The song speaks about the importance of teaching children to recognize that personality and character are more important than popularity and outward appearances. The song is performed by 11-year-old Nashville singer <strong>Tristan McIntosh</strong>, and choreographed by local teens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The culture of bullying won&rsquo;t end until people across the country take action and show children and teens that they care,&rdquo; says Julie Hertzog, director of PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center. &ldquo;Unity Dance Day celebrates the influence of music and dance as a powerful avenue to reach kids and teens about the bullying prevention message.&rdquo; </p>

 <p><strong>Promote the Event at Your School <br />

 <p><strong>How Can My School or Organization Participate?</strong></p>
 
 <ol>
  <li>Determine a location. For example: the school lunchroom, the hallway, a classroom, the football field or an assembly.</li>
 	<li>Establish a time. Will it take place in the morning, during lunch, during half-time, or after school?</li>
 	<li>Consider who should participate. Ideas include:
  	<ul>
 <li>An athletic team leads the dance, learn the steps, and encourage others to join.</li>
 <li>One person leads the dance, one person joins in, then another, followed by several others, with an invite for anyone watching to join.</li>
 <li>Ten students lead the dance and invite others to join.</li>
 </ul>
  
  </li>
 	<li>Consider what is needed to play the song. For example: a sound system, the school&rsquo;s PA system, or speakers and an MP3 player?</li>
</ol>
 <p><strong>What Next? Practice, Practice, Practice!</strong></p>
 
 <ol>
 <li>Watch this video showing the dance.</li>
 <li>Watch this video showing the choreography.</li>
 <li>Download the MP3 file of &quot;You Can't Take That Away From Me.&quot;</li>
 <li>Practice the choreography with anyone who will be involved on Unity Dance Day.</li>
 <li>Determine how the dance will be introduced. For example: will a student emcee announce it, will it be a surprise, will the school principal invite everyone to the appointed place?</li>
 <li>Decide if there will be post dance activities. Ideas include:
 	<ul>
 	 <li>Setting up a table to <a href="/bullying/digitalpetition/">sign &quot;The End of Bullying Begins With Me&quot; petition</a></li>
 	 <li>Creating your own &quot;Unity Ribbons.&rdquo; <em>Purchase a spool of orange ribbon (5/8&rdquo; wide) at a craft or dollar store. Cut them into 12&rdquo; strips. With a black marker write UNITY, &ldquo;The End of Bullying Begins With Me,&rdquo; or create your own bullying prevention message. Then tie them around your wrist, on your notebook or to your locker door.</em></li>
 	 <li> Post a UNITY banner in the hallway for everyone to sign. <em>Purchase a blank 4' x 8' piece of cardstock at a local print or copy store. Write the word UNITY on it in color markers. Provide color markers for people to sign their name and write a statement about why they believe in supporting each other.</em></li>
	 </ul></li>
 </ol>
 	<p><strong>On Unity Dance Day</strong></p>
  <ol>
  <li>At the time you have determined - dance and unite!</li>
  <li>Videotape the dance.</li>
  <li>Post the video and share event photos on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=276546172369289" target="_blank">UNITY DANCE DAY Facebook Event</a></li>
  <li>Encourage everyone to participate in any post dance activities</li>
  </ol>
