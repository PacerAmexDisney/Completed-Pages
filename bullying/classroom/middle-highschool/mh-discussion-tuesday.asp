    <p><strong><em>What Can You Do?</em></strong></p>
    <h3>Morning Announcement</h3>
    <p>Today&rsquo;s bullying prevention topic is &quot;What Can You Do?&quot; Everyone knows that bullying situations involve the student who's targeted and the student doing the bullying. Did you also know that many situations involve bystanders&mdash;students who aren't involved directly but see what's happening?</p>
    <p>Bystanders are powerful. In fact, more than half of bullying situations will end if bystanders step in. Direct confrontation is one way to intervene. Indirect help&mdash;such as not encouraging the situation or offering support to the person being bullied&mdash;is also effective. Bystanders can also let other students know that bullying is not okay. In your classroom today, you will be learning about different ways to respond to bullying situations. </p>
