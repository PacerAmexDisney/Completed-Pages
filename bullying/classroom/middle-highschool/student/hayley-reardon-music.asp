    <p><img src="/bullying/resources/activities/images/hayley-brick-wall.jpg" width="200" height="249" alt="" class="fltrt" />Music is the universal language of emotion and <a href="http://www.hayleyreardon.com/"><strong>Hayley Reardon</strong></a> expresses herself so eloquently through her original  compositions. Hayley taps into her talent and gifts to create poignant,  heartfelt songs about being a teen. Hayley shares her music and lyrics with  PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center in the hopes others will be touched  by the message, inspired to take action, and motivated to share in the process  of creating a world in which no one feels alone. Hayley's original music and videos  can be played in classroom, and are accompanied by classroom  discussion questions.</p>

    <h2>Activities </h2>
    <p>Middle  and high school students can watch the music videos, which are   accompanied by  activities and discussion questions which are integrated with song   lyrics.</p>
    <p>Hayley writes, &ldquo;<em>I think music and art are some of the most  powerful ways for us to make sense of our feelings and help us to relate to one  and other. </em></p>
    <p><em>The past two years I&rsquo;ve worked with PACER by using two of my songs  (She&rsquo;s Falling and Stand Together) and creating classroom toolkits that are  related directly to bullying and how to prevent it in a classroom environment.  This year, however, our idea was to focus more on creating unity and bringing  students together. The goal of these exercises and the heart of the songs that  go along with them are to help students better understand one and other and  hopefully uncover and embrace each other&rsquo;s individuality.</em>&rdquo;</p>
    <p>      Watch the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0N03JFW2tM" target="_blank">Behind the Song</a>&rdquo; video of Hayley sharing her insights  about &ldquo;Where the Artists Go&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tribe&rdquo;</p>
    <h3>&ldquo;Where the Artists Go&rdquo; </h3>
    <p><em>&ldquo;This song was inspired by an in-class assignment that allowed me to  get to know a classmate on a deeper level than I ever had before. The purpose  of this exercise is to help us, as students, to better understand each other  and learn to embrace and accept the things that make us individuals.&rdquo;</em></p>

    <h3>&ldquo;Tribe&rdquo;</h3>
    <p><em>&ldquo;This song was written about me learning for myself that the best  things we have to offer to the world are the things that make us different, and  then learning to accept and be proud of those things. If we can learn to  embrace our own individuality, hopefully we can then learn to seek out and  value the individuality of the students around us.&rdquo;</em></p>

    <h3>&ldquo;Stand Together&rdquo;</h3>
    <p>Hayley writes, &ldquo;<em>Think  about the amount of time we spend at home with our families versus in school  with our classmates. Whether we like it or not, school is a big part of our  lives and we&rsquo;re all here because we have to be. Growing up is hard for each of  us in different ways but would be easier on everyone if we could face our time  together as a team. Not a divided or broken team but a team who understands  that we all have our own strengths and weaknesses and something to contribute.  Ultimately, the only question we need to ask ourselves is what stops us from  having each other&rsquo;s backs and choosing to stand together</em>.&rdquo;</p>

    <h3>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s  Falling&rdquo; &ndash; Original Song Dedicated to Memory of Phoebe Prince </h3>
    <p>Hayley writes &ldquo;<em>To me, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s  Falling&rdquo; is about not knowing how to help someone who you can see is falling  apart</em>.&rdquo; Although Hayley&rsquo;s song was written about a girl she knew  personally, she, like all of us, was moved by the&nbsp; story of Phoebe  Prince,&nbsp; a 15 year old Irish immigrant attending school in Massachusetts,  who after months of being subjected to bullying from her peers, committed  suicide on January 14, 2010</p>
