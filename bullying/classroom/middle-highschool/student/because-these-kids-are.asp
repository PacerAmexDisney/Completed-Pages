    <h3>Izabela&rsquo;s Story</h3>
    
    <p>Izabela Vidovic jumped right into the spotlight at the gentle age of 7 with her powerful, yet angelic voice, in musicals such as &ldquo;MARY POPPINS&rdquo;, &ldquo;CAMP ROCK&rdquo;, &ldquo;ANNIE&rdquo;, &ldquo;BROADWAY BABES&rdquo; and &ldquo;SUMMER FINALE&rdquo;. Her tenacious personality and her love of performing quickly expanded her into the world of film and television. To date, Izabela's had Guest Starring television roles on acclaimed programs such as &ldquo;HARRY'S LAW&rdquo; with Kathy Bates, &ldquo;CRIMINAL MINDS&rdquo; working opposite Mariana Klaveno, &ldquo;RAISING HOPE&rdquo; with Martha Plimpton and Lucas Neff, &ldquo;UP ALL NIGHT&rdquo; with Christina Applegate, as well as Series Regular roles in two star-studded FOX pilots &ldquo;LITTLE BROTHER&rdquo; working opposite John Stamos, &ldquo;LITTLE IN COMMON&rdquo; with Heather Graham, and the Amazon pilot &quot;ZOMBIELAND&quot;.

    <p><strong>Interview</strong></p>

    <p><strong>What inspired your film?</strong> I was inspired to do Because These Kids because I wanted to make a difference! I wanted to show that we are all connected. Meaning that we all have the capability of being hurt and we all have a choice as to what to do with those feelings. Do we strike back or strike out... bully? Or do we stop and really look at ourselves and others, try and understand, try and create change in ourselves and hopefully others! I really want Because These Kids are to open people's minds.</p>
