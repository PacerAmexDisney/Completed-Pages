    <p><em><strong>Bullying Prevention: It&rsquo;s Not Just a Month</strong></em></p>
    <h3>Morning Announcement</h3>
    <p>Today&rsquo;s topic is &ldquo;Bullying Prevention: It&rsquo;s Not Just a Month.&rdquo; National Bullying Prevention Awareness Month was created to raise awareness and provide options to respond to bullying. Bullying isn&rsquo;t something that can be resolved in a month, however. Students and adults need to work on it throughout the school year to be effective.</p>
      <p>For many years bullying was thought to be a normal part of childhood and that targets just needed to toughen up and deal with it. We now know that bullying has long-term negative effects. Students who are bullied often have a loss of self-esteem, endure physical symptoms such as stomachaches and headaches, begin to miss school, suffer slipping grades, and become depressed. Students who bully are more likely to have a criminal record as an adult. Witnesses report feeling less safe at school and they fear that the bullying might happen to them.</p>
    <p>Bullying affects everyone. Together, through a united effort, everyone can affect how bullying is addressed in school.</p>
<h3> <strong>Classroom Education and Activities</strong></h3>
