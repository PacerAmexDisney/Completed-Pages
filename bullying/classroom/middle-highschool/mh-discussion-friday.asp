	<p><em><strong>The End of Bullying Begins with You</strong></em></p>
  <h3>Morning Announcement</h3>
<p>Today &rsquo;s theme is &ldquo;The End of Bullying Begins with You.&rdquo; Bullying prevention takes a united effort of students and adults. It also takes an individual effort. It is about each person taking responsibility. The end of bullying begins with the principal, the end of bullying begins with teachers, the end of bullying begins with all school personnel, and the end of bullying also begins with you--with each student being willing to say that bullying will not be accepted and that everyone has a right to be safe at school.</p>
<h3><strong>Classroom Education and Activities</strong></h3>
    	<p>Active Learning and Discussion</p>
    <p><strong>Share Your Opinion!</strong> &ndash; Participate in an interactive poll on things you can do to create a safe and supportive school and online environment.</p>

<p><strong>Student Action Plan - </strong>Ready to take action to address bullying? Maybe not sure how to start? As a student, bullying is something that impacts you, your peers, and your school &ndash; whether you&rsquo;re the target of bullying, a witness, or the person who bullies. Bullying can end, but that won&rsquo;t happen unless students, parents, and educators work together and take action. Start by creating a plan that works for you and your situation.</p>
