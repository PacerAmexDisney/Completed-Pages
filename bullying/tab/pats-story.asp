	<p>I would like to share with you the story about a young boy by the name of Pat who was fascinated with the world around him.</p>
	<p>When Pat was three years old his dad helped him to find his first agate. He thought they were treasures because of their colors and interesting designs. Finding, collecting, and polishing agates became a passion for him. Everywhere he would go, he would look for agates. His head was always looking down to the ground, always on the hunt for another one, more beautiful than the last. </p>
	<p>One day while looking for agates he found something that he had never seen before. He started to jump up and down with excitement because he couldn&rsquo;t believe his discovery. His mom identified it as a fossil of a sea shell. From that day on, Pat&rsquo;s passions grew to include fossil collecting. He was fortunate enough to take several classes at the science museum in which he went on fossil walks. By the time he was in the first grade, he had quite a large collection of fossils, including real dinosaur bones. One of his goals in life was to find his very own dinosaur skeleton.</p>
	<p>As I had said earlier, Pat was truly interested in the world around him, both the ancient and present, from King Tut to Halley&rsquo;s Comet. His present world interests included playing, watching, and reading about sports. His favorites were hockey, skiing, soccer, and golf. As a third grader, he wrote to all the professional hockey teams for information, team pictures, and emblems. He even covered the walls of his room, including the ceiling, in newspaper clippings about the results of various hockey games.</p>
	<p>Even though Pat loved sports and was good at scoring, he was not a star when it came to endurance. He was much smaller than the other boys his age. In fact, he was the skinniest boy in his fifth grade class. Through his years growing up, some of the boys in his neighborhood use to tease him when he did not do as well as they did. Pat was sensitive about this because he loved sports so much and wanted to be like everyone else. Not only was he put down for not doing as well in sports as some of the boys, but he was also bullied for other things. </p>
	<p>One example was being humiliated in the fourth grade after he decided to get a perm for his unmanageable hair. Some of the boys in the neighborhood threw him to the ground and called him very embarrassing and inappropriate names. They even carried this bullying into Pat&rsquo;s classroom and school encouraging others to bully him. </p>
	<p>On the first evening of spring break during Pat&rsquo;s fifth grade year, he was involved in a neighborhood argument. Instead of physically fighting he fought back with words and then ran away. He became involved in a physical fight anyway and was kicked really hard in the chest. He fell to the ground and didn&rsquo;t move. All of the neighborhood kids said &ldquo;Pat get up, you&rsquo;re scaring us&rdquo;, but Pat did not move. They said &ldquo;Pat get up, quit playing games&rdquo;, but still he did not move. Finally, one of the older children knelt down and picked him up to carry him home.</p>
	<p>When they were half way there, the children really became frightened. They laid him down in the grass and ran for help. Two of the children came upon Pat&rsquo;s dad who had come to bring him in for the night. They said, &ldquo;hurry, come quick, Pat has been hurt.&rdquo; Pat&rsquo;s dad ran with them and soon came upon Pat lying in the grass. He could see right away that Pat was not breathing, and so he knelt down next to his son and started CPR. Soon the ambulance came and took Pat to the hospital. </p>
	<p>All of the parents and children waited to hear that he was okay, but Pat was not okay. Pat died. The reason I know so much about this story is that Pat was my son. The reason I want you to know this story is that if you ever see someone bullied by another, help that person if you can but do not stick up for the bully. Never stand back and do nothing but go for help immediately. Never get involved in fighting because you may hurt someone very seriously, or you may be seriously hurt yourself.</p>
	<p>My son Pat died and I still miss him every day. He brought so much joy to our family with his humor and passion for life. He would get so excited about the littlest things, his smile melting my heart every time. There is not a holiday that passes when I do not feel his presence and wish he were with us. I feel sad every time he is not here to celebrate with his family. I feel sad that he was never able to fulfill his dreams. I feel sad because I miss my son so much and I can never have him back. </p>
	<p>By sharing this story, I hope to make a difference in someone&rsquo;s life. I hope that you will help to put an end to bullying.</p>
