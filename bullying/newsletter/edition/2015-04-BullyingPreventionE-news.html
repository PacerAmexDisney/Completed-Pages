  <h3>Teen Vogue Article &mdash; <em>The Bystander Effect: Why You Don&rsquo;t Stand Up When You Should</em></h3>
  <p>Teen Vogue and Huffington Post recently published a compelling article on bullying, &ldquo;<em>The Bystander Effect: Why You Don&rsquo;t Stand Up When You Should,&rdquo;</em> written by Courtney Lindstrand. The article includes expert tips on how to take a stand when you see someone being bullied, including information from PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center.</p>
  <p>Lindstrand writes, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.teenvogue.com/about/bullying?mbid=synd_huffpoteen">Bullying</a> is an intimidating, deplorable problem, whether it's playing out in the high school cafeteria or around the internship water cooler. But when you're not the bullied party yourself, it can be tough to know exactly how to handle it &mdash; which is one reason that people often don't step in. Another one? When you see someone being victimized, you tend to think someone else will intervene. Psychologists call this the &quot;bystander effect,&quot; and it happens when your brain creates a rationale around why you shouldn't take a stand. But the truth is that you can't count on anyone else to take the lead: Sometimes it has to be you. And since we know that's not always the easiest thing to do, we chatted with Julie Hertzog, the director of PACER's <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying">National Bullying Prevention Center</a>, to get her tips on what to do when you see a super uncool situation unfolding, and how to step in without getting caught in the crossfire.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/teen-vogue/the-bystander-effect-why-_b_6277886.html">Read more &gt;&gt;&gt;</a></p>

<h3>Helping Your Child</h3>
  <p>Bullying can be an isolating experience &mdash; not just for the kids involved, but for their parents, too. If you discover that your child is being bullied or &nbsp;is bullying others, you might not know how to respond. But now there's help. We're excited to introduce a new online resource for parents that offers advice on helping your child if they are being bullied, bullying others, or witnessing bullying. There is also specific information for parents of children with disabilities. Remember &mdash; you are not alone. <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/resources/helping-your-child.asp">Visit the page &gt;&gt;&gt;</a></p>

<h3>Send Your Story or Video</h3>
  <p>Sarah, an 8th grader, shared her powerful poem titled, &ldquo;Head High&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>He walks down the hall with his shoulders hunched,<br />
  When his head should be held high. <br />
  He keeps his chin down to stay out of sight, <br />
  Just trying his best to get by. <br />
  Insults fly by his head…horrible and mean, <br />
  He looks for help everywhere, but no help can be seen.</em><br />
