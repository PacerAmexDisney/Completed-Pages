<h3>Notifying the School About Bullying – Using a Template Letter</h3>
  <p>Parents should contact school staff each time their child informs them that he or she has been bullied. PACER Center has created template letters that parents may use as a guide for writing a letter to their child&rsquo;s school. These letters contain standard language and &ldquo;fill in the blank&rdquo; spaces so the letter can be customized for your child, including specific letters for children with disabilities. <a href="http://www.pacer.org/publications/bullypdf/BP-19.pdf">Read more &gt;&gt;&gt;</a></p>
