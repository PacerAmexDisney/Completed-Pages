 <h2 align="center">BULLYING PREVENTION E-NEWS</h2>
<h3>PACER&rsquo;S NATIONAL BULLYING PREVENTION MONTH</h3>
<p>Now that October is over, we want to thank everyone who participated in PACER’s National Bullying Prevention Month! We heard some amazing, inspiring stories from across the United States about schools, communities, and organizations coming together to show their support for those affected by bullying. Your compassion, dedication, and enthusiasm make our work possible. PACER also had wonderful support from our corporate partners, including the <a href="http://www.raiseagiant.com/">&ldquo;Raise a Giant&rdquo;</a> campaign from Green Giant, Disney&rsquo;s multi-media outreach featuring <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/video/player.asp?video=60">Keegan Allen</a>, star of the ABC Family show &ldquo;Pretty Little Liars,&rdquo; and the <a href="http://www.customink.com/stopbullying">Be Good to Each Other</a> campaign from CustomInk. PACER thanks all of its <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/nbpm/partners/corporate-and-celebrity.asp">corporate partners</a>, including IBM, Dairy Queen, CenturyLink, and Facebook, for their continuing support. </p>
<h3>THE &ldquo;WE WILL GENERATION&rdquo;: PACER LAUNCHES STUDENT-TO-STUDENT BULLYING PREVENTION PROGRAM</h3>
<p>Research shows that peer support is an effective way to address bullying. On Oct. 1, PACER launched the WE WILL Generation, a nationwide campaign and peer-to-peer curriculum that provides students with the inspiration and education to take action against bullying in schools, the community, and online. The online curriculum, which is built around the concept that older students can learn to teach younger students how to respond when they see a bullying situation, is available to schools free of charge. <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/wewillgen/">Learn more</a>. </p>
<h3>RAISE A GIANT: WRITE A LETTER TO YOUR CHILD</h3>
<p>Adults can play a significant role in helping children prevent bullying. On Oct. 1, PACER and Green Giant launched a new partnership – the <em>Raise a Giant</em> campaign – to help parents and children find the courage to speak up and take action against bullying. The campaign is centered around an online open-letter writing campaign at <a href="http://www.raiseagiant.com/">raiseagiant.com</a>, where parents can use the power of storytelling to stand tall against bullying. As part of the campaign, the 55-foot tall Green Giant statue in Blue Earth, Minn., wore an orange toga for Unity Day on Oct. 9, and the town was renamed Orange Earth for the month. Green Giant&rsquo;s efforts have received <a href="http://www.twincities.com/news/ci_24271206/minn-town-highlight-bullying-prevention">nationwide media coverage</a>. </p>
<h3>PACER SUPPORTERS ASKED TO &lsquo;CHOOSE ORANGE&rsquo;</h3>
<p>When PACER created National Bullying Prevention Month in 2006, orange was adopted as the official color of bullying prevention. PACER recently launched &ldquo;Choose Orange,&rdquo; a national campaign to raise awareness for bullying prevention in a powerful, visual way. By wearing and sharing Choose Orange snap wrist bands, people are choosing to prevent bullying through kindness, compassion, and positivity. The popular wrist bands, developed by the trend-setting designers of Big Time Brands, are available at <a href="http://www.chooseorange.org/">chooseorange.org</a>. Proceeds from the campaign support the work of PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center. <a href="http://www.chooseorange.org/">Find out more</a></p>
<h3>UNITY DAY SPOTLIGHT - STUDENT</h3>
<p>When Jacob Law&rsquo;s mom, Tina, heard that he wanted to get involved with Unity Day, she thought all she was going to do was buy him a t-shirt. But Jacob had a much bigger plan in mind. Jacob gathered a group of students at his high school in Delaware (Joe, Shannon, Cathryne, Vanessa, Delvin, and Steven) who were all passionate about bullying prevention and set about creating a community-wide Unity Day event. Soon the whole town was involved. From petitioning his school to allow the event to making ribbons to hand out at a football game to inviting local businesses to participate, Jacob&rsquo;s efforts on Unity Day were truly inspirational. When Jacob delivered a speech after receiving a proclamation from the mayor declaring October 9th Unity Day for the entire city, he demonstrated the true spirit of Unity Day – bringing people together to end bullying. <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/getinvolved/student-action/events/2013-Jacob-Law.asp"><strong>Read more.</strong></a></p>
<h3>UNITY DAY FEATURED IN &ldquo;TIME MAGAZINE FOR KIDS&rdquo;</h3>
<p><em>Time Magazine for Kids </em>profiled the Unity Day efforts of Grace Hertzog, whose mother, Julie Hertzog, is the director of PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center. Grace, a sixth grader, went to school on Unity Day decked out in orange – glasses, shoes, beads, skirt, and a Unity Day t-shirt! &quot;When awareness is raised around bullying, students no longer feel alone, and they learn they have options,&rdquo; Julie said. &ldquo;All kids have the right to feel safe at school and in their community.&quot; <a href="http://www.timeforkids.com/news/united-front/105091">Read the article.</a></p>
<h3>UNITY DAY SPOTLIGHT – SCHOOL</h3>
<p>Queen Anne's County Public Schools in Maryland hosted its inaugural Unity Day event on Wednesday, Oct. 9. During the day, cheerleaders and super fans from the Baltimore Ravens of the NFL, as well as Looney Tunes characters, visited each school to promote bullying prevention. At the start of the school day every student and school employee was given a &quot;Bullying stops with me&quot; T-shirt – about 10,000 shirts total! – to help spread the message. Also during the day each elementary school revealed a Friendship Bench, a bench for students to sit on if they ever feel left out. After the students put on their new shirts, students from each school went out to fields on school property and spelled out &ldquo;no bullying&rdquo;.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/getinvolved/school-action/"><strong>Read more.</strong></a>

<h3>SHARE YOUR STORY WITH OTHERS</h3>
<p>High school sophomore Irene Henderson is no stranger to bullying. In middle school she was belittled, pushed and chastised. Irene helped raise awareness about bullying by hosting a series of bullying prevention events during National Bullying Prevention Month. She also shared her song, &ldquo;Bully,&rdquo; in the hopes of helping other students cope with bullying.</p>
<p>Irene writes: <em>&ldquo;I was bullied in my middle school year when I was participating in the School Talent show. Since I love singing, I am resentful to participate in that program anymore because it has destroyed my confidence. However, it did not stop me to write my music and sing at home and joined a small studio. &ldquo;Bully&rdquo; has given me the chance to prove to those who put me down.&rdquo;</em></p>
