<h3>Great Resource: Help Your Child Recognize Signs of Bullying</h3>
   <p>Children may not always realize that they are being bullied. The handout, &ldquo;Help Your Child Recognize the Signs of Bullying&rdquo; is a helpful tool that will prepare parents to have a conversation with their kids about bullying. It&rsquo;s important for parents to consider how they will respond to their child&rsquo;s questions and emotions, and the handout addresses that issue. It will also help parents decide what information they would like to share with their child about bullying. <a href="http://www.pacer.org/publications/bullypdf/BP-2.pdf">Read more</a></p>

<h3>Share Your Story With Others</h3>
   <p>&ldquo;My son Luke is 8 years old and is in the third grade. I&rsquo;m not really a sports kind of guy so Luke does not have that influence from me and therefore has other interests. He came home one day from school and, after my usual question of &lsquo;How was your day?&rsquo; he offered this reply: &lsquo;All the boys in my class like sports, so they kind of tease me, but that's OK,&rsquo; he said as he shrugged his shoulders. &lsquo;They laugh at me because I am different; I laugh at them because they&rsquo;re all the same.&rsquo; I asked him where he heard that. He answered,&nbsp;&lsquo;I read it somewhere.&rsquo; I cried with pride.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/stories/">Read more</a> contributions and offer one of your own – a video, story, poem, artwork, or audio clip that expresses how you feel about bullying and its impact on the world around you.
