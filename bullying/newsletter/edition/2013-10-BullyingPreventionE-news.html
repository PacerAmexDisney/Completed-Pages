 <h2 align="center">BULLYING PREVENTION E-NEWS</h2>
<h3>What Will You Do for PACER’s National Bullying Prevention Month?</h3>
<p>During October, raise awareness of PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Month by reaching out to your school or community, or by making a personal commitment to prevent bullying. Big events, small acts of kindness – they all contribute to a powerful movement to show targets of bullying that they are not alone. Everyone can do something, somewhere, somehow. Maybe you can organize a Unity Day event at your school or attend a Run, Walk, Roll Against Bullying in your community. Maybe you&rsquo;ll make a commitment to invite a student who looks lonely to sit with you at lunch, or to say something kind to each of your classmates. Whatever you do to take part in National Bullying Prevention Month, you will be helping to build a kinder and safer community for everyone.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/nbpm/"><strong>Learn more.</strong></a></p>
<h3>PACER Launches the WE WILL Generation™</h3>
<p>Today&rsquo;s generation of students is ready to take action and uniquely positioned to prevent and stop bullying. What they need is education, support, and inspiration – and a creative program that will give them the practical skills to be part of the solution. The WE WILL Generation is an exciting new initiative that uses a students-teaching-students model. <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/wewillgen/"><strong>Join the WE WILL Generation.</strong></a></p>
<h3>Run, Walk, Roll Against Bullying Events Raise Awareness Nationwide</h3>
<p>From Saco, Maine to Reno, Nev., organizations across the country are staging Run, Walk, Roll Against Bullying events to raise awareness in their communities. It&rsquo;s not too late to hold your own event during <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/nbpm/">PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Month</a> in October. Download PACER&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/nbpm/runwalkroll/">free toolkit</a> to learn how your community organization or school can participate.

<h3>U.S. Department of Education Releases New Bullying Prevention Guidance</h3>
<p>On Aug. 20, 2013, the U.S. Department of Education released a new &lsquo;Dear Colleague&rsquo; letter outlining school districts&rsquo; responsibilities to address bullying of students with disabilities. The new guidance states that bullying of students with disabilities that prevents them from receiving meaningful educational benefit is considered a denial of their right to a free appropriate public education (FAPE). <strong>Read the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ed.gov/policy/speced/guid/idea/memosdcltrs/bullyingdcl-8-20-13.doc">letter and additional resources on effective bullying prevention practices.</a></strong></p>
<h3>NEW! Spookley the Square Pumpkin offers fun new activities and T-shirts</h3>
<p>Holiday Hill Enterprises and PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center have partnered to create more activities, including a downloadable &ldquo;Spookley Storybook Trail,&rdquo; discussion guides, and handbook for the Spookley classroom play.

<h3>NEW! By Students, For Students: Teens create effective toolkits for bullying prevention</h3>
<p>When it comes to bullying prevention, students may be the real experts. Several talented young people have created toolkits to accompany their artistic endeavors in order to inspire, educate, and activate their peers. Here’s an example of a toolkit:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/classroom/middle-highschool/student/jetset-getset.asp"><strong>&ldquo;Stronger&rdquo;</strong></a><br />
  Jetset Getset, a teen country music group from Indiana, created a toolkit around their song &ldquo;Stronger,&rdquo; written to help young people who are feeling discouraged.&nbsp;The writer, Jennifer Eliason, says that&nbsp; &quot;The teenage years are&nbsp;a time when self-esteem can take a beating. We wanted to write a song&nbsp;about how you can rise above the challenges and the experience can make you stronger.&quot; <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/resources/toolkits/student/"><strong>Learn more.</strong></a></p>
<h3>PACER and CustomInk Invite You to &lsquo;Be Good To Each Other&rsquo;</h3>
<p> PACER is pleased to partner with CustomInk, the “design online” custom T-shirt company, as part of its “Be Good to Each Other” campaign. The campaign takes a stand for kindness and tolerance and uses the power of custom T-shirts to do good. <strong>All profits from this partnership support the work of PACER’s National Bullying Prevention Center.</strong> You can support PACER (and look good doing it!) in three different ways: order the official National Bullying Prevention Month T-shirt, order a celebrity T-shirt design, or create your own custom design. No matter which option you choose, you can wear your shirt with pride as you commit to “Be Good to Each Other!” Please note that new orders will be delivered the week of October 28th. <a href="http://www.customink.com/stopbullying" target="_blank">Learn more</a>.</p>
<h3>Everyone&rsquo;s Contribution Matters</h3>
<p>You can make a difference. Schools, organizations, parents, and students each play a role in addressing bullying prevention. Every contribution, no matter how small, makes a difference. You could host a community event, speak up for someone who is being bullied, or donate to PACER’s National Bullying Prevention Center – anything that says you recognize bullying as a problem and you want to do something about it. <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/getinvolved/contributions/" target="_blank">More ideas to get involved</a></p>
<p><em>Here&rsquo;s what Trevin Hunte of &ldquo;The Voice&rdquo; is doing:</em><br />
  Trevin Hunte from NBC&rsquo;s The Voice Season 3 Team Ceelo is speaking out about bullying prevention on behalf of PACER. &ldquo;I personally know because I have experienced bullying,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;That is why I support bullying campaigns every chance I can, because I don&rsquo;t want kids to feel like they are alone, because they are not the only ones who have gone through it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trevin says, &ldquo;I am fortunate to be able to combine two of my passions, my music and to give to PACER with my <a href="http://www.pledgemusic.com/trevinhunte" target="_blank">Pledgemusic  fundraiser campaign</a>. With the campaign, I am raising money for my music project, while a percentage of the pledges goes to PACER.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/getinvolved/contributions/" target="_blank">Read more and listen to Trevin&rsquo;s song</a>.</p>
