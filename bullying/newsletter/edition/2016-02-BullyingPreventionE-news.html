<p>Bullying is an issue that no child should ever have to endure. Fortunately, there are people who care and take action. The Unity Awards are designed to honor and celebrate a few of those individuals and groups who have made outstanding contributions to address and prevent bullying – whether it’s building awareness of bullying prevention, inspiring and empowering others to take positive actions, or advocating for those who need support.  Nominations are now open for the second annual Unity Awards; anyone can submit a nomination and the online form is open through April 15, 2016. The Unity Awards will be held on Wednesday, May 25th, 2016, at the Bloomington Center for the Arts in Bloomington, Minnesota. <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/getinvolved/unity-awards.asp#.VsNMxzQdDs0.facebook">Learn more &gt;&gt;&gt;</a></p></td>

<h3>Advice for Kids and Teens</h3>
<p><strong><em>Read Carmen&rsquo;s Advice for Elementary School Students</em></strong><br />
  Carmen is a member of the Club Crew, and she knows a lot about bullying. She gives great advice about bullying to kids around the country. If you&rsquo;ve seen bullying, been bullied, or even show bullying behavior, Carmen can help. Read some of her advice below:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Dear Carmen,</p>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t know what to do if my best friend gets bullied because I don&rsquo;t want to get bullied next. I know I have to tell an adult but what else do I do.<br />
     - Kyndall, 4th grade</p>
  <p>Dear Kyndall,</p>
  <p>It's really great that you want to help your friend; that's very brave of you.  It's important to remember that there are a lot of ways you can help and you can do what feels safe to you. The most effective way to stop a bullying situation is to show support for the student being bullied. You can do this by talking to them, telling them that what happened to them isn&rsquo;t OK, or inviting them to join you in an activity. By reminding your friend that he or she isn&rsquo;t alone, you can make a huge difference. <a href="http://www.pacerkidsagainstbullying.org/kab/what-is-bullying/carmens-advice/">Read more &gt;&gt;&gt;</a></p>
