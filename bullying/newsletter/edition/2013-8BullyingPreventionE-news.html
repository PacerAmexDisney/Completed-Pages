   <h3>Schools Taking Action: Citrus Grove Elementary Takes a Stand</h3>
     <p>When Shawna Hixon and Lana Barros from Citrus Grove Elementary in Palm City, Fla., learned how many students at their school were worried about bullying, they decided to take action. They developed an innovative program, which is designed to creatively engage students to take action against bullying. The program encompasses everything from presentations to personal statements to school-wide participation. The message to their peers is that you can be friends even if you&rsquo;re different from each other, and that students should &ldquo;Be an iStander, not a bystander.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/getinvolved/school-action/events/istanders-citrus-grove.asp">Read more about the program.</a></p>
   
   <h3>Everyone&rsquo;s Contribution Matters</h3>
     <p>You can make a difference. Schools, organizations, parents, and students each play a role in addressing bullying prevention. Every contribution, no matter how small, makes a difference. You could host a community event, stand up for someone who is being bullied, or donate to a bullying prevention organization – anything that says you recognize bullying as a problem and you want to do something about it. <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/getinvolved/contributions/">More ideas to get involved</a></p>
   
   <h3>Here&rsquo;s what a group from Babson College in Massachusetts is doing…</h3>
  <p>&ldquo;We are a group of young entrepreneurs named UNI.  We are a non-profit organization in that we give all our profits to charity. In this case we chose PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center. We feel particularly connected to this cause because many of us have been bullied before and have first-hand experience with it. The purpose of our business is to raise awareness for bullying.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/getinvolved/contributions/">Read the full story</a> </p>
   
   <h3>Share Your Story with Others</h3>
  <p>&ldquo;Once when I was in the second grade, a girl in my class formed a group that would make fun of me and my friends. They used to call me names like stupid face, bug eyes, wimp, loser and they used to whisper to each other and say that I was useless and that I was not needed in life. That group didn&rsquo;t just make fun of me. They made fun of all the girls in my class. When they made fun of me, I used to feel so rotten inside and feel that no one would understand if I told them so I tried so hard to ignore them but it didn&rsquo;t help. It made it worse. I used to cry sometimes at night and used to hope that it would get better. It did after I told the teacher.&rdquo;</p>
