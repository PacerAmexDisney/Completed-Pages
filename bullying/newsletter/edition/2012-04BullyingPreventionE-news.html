<h3><strong>PACER  Partners With &ldquo;<a href="http://thebullyproject.com/" target="_blank">Bully</a>&rdquo; Movie to Raise Awareness</strong><br />
</h3>
<p>America is waking up to the harsh realities of  bullying thanks to PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center and the powerful  new documentary &ldquo;<a href="http://thebullyproject.com/" target="_blank">Bully</a>.&rdquo; The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/30/movies/bully-a-documentary-by-lee-hirsch.html" target="_blank">&ldquo;New  York Times&rdquo; review</a> says the film documents the emergence  of a movement and a &ldquo;shift in consciousness of the kind that occurs when  isolated, oppressed individuals discover that they are not alone.&rdquo; As a partner  in the Bully Project, PACER is providing educators, students, families, and  individuals with the tools to address bullying. The critically acclaimed film has  sparked a national discussion on the issue and its website offers PACER&rsquo;s  bullying prevention resources for children with disabilities. </p>
<h3><strong>Teens  Drive Bullying Prevention Movement in Their Communities</strong><br />
</h3>
<p>Teens are taking a lead role in the bullying  prevention movement in their communities by making the decision to stand up,  protect others, and show their support for this important cause. One way to do  that is to become involved in the political process. The voice of Minnesota  students was heard Feb. 11 at the State Capitol in St. Paul as more than 100  teens wearing orange rallied to support stronger bullying prevention  legislation. Want to organize a student rally in your state? <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/getinvolved/student-action/events/2012-StudentsDemandingChangeRally.asp" target="_blank">Learn  more</a></p>
<h3><strong>Students  Use Their Creativity to Support the Cause</strong><br />
</h3>
<p>Students everywhere are raising money for bullying  prevention in unique and creative ways. When Josh in Arkansas invited friends  to his 10th birthday party, he asked them not to bring gifts. Instead, he  requested they make a $5 donation to PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention  Center. &ldquo;Josh was able to raise $155 at the party with a matching donation from  my husband and I,&rdquo; his mom wrote. &ldquo;We hope this helps in your efforts to make  life easier for the millions of kids who face bullying every day.&rdquo; Tell us about  your cool fundraising ideas (email <a href="mailto:Bullying411@PACER.org">Bullying411@PACER.org</a>)  or show your support and <a href="https://pacer.ejoinme.org/MyPages/DonateToTheNationalBullyingPreventionCenter/tabid/229451/Default.aspx" target="_blank">donate  now</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Help  Others by Sharing Your Creative Contributions</strong><br />
</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Walking through the halls  all shaken and scared, she covered her face thinking no one would stare.  Staring into her eyes, I could feel the pain, the sorrow, the feeling she felt  as if she was nobody…&rdquo; Those are the painful words of a poem &lsquo;Taylor&rsquo; shared on  our websites. <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/stories/">Read  more</a> of this and other personal submissions and offer one of your own  – a video, story, poem, artwork, or audio clip that expresses how you feel about  bullying and its impact on the world around you.
