<h3>You Can Sit With Us – An Inspiring Fundraising Story</h3>
<p>While talking about kindness during class, 13 girls in the 8th grade discussed bullying and ways they could make an impact. As a group, the girls created T-shirts with the slogan, &ldquo;You can sit with us,&rdquo; and a peace sign on the back. Each girl shared a word that described kindness, such as &lsquo;kind,&rsquo; &lsquo;beautiful,&rsquo; and &lsquo;brave,&rsquo; which was placed within the peace sign. The girls are now selling the shirts at their school and hope to see every student wearing this message of kindness. <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/stories/?id=520">Read more &gt;&gt;&gt;</a></p>
