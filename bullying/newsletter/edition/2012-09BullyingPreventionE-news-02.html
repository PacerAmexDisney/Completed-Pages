  <h3>Share Your Story With Others </h3>
  <p>&ldquo;Hi, my name is Emily. At the end of last school year I was happy, but as the last day of school ended, these three girls texted me. All of their messages said just about the same thing: &quot;We were never friends. You're annoying and I never liked you. Don't talk to me anymore.&quot; I was broken. I thought these three girls were my friends.&nbsp;Apparently&nbsp;not.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/stories/">Read more</a> contributions and offer one of your own – a video, story, poem, artwork, or audio clip that expresses how you feel about bullying and its impact on the world around you.
