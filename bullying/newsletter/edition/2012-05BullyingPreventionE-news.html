              <h3><strong>Save the Date:  Wednesday, Oct. 10 is Unity Day!</strong></h3>
              <p>Mark your calendars now for Unity Day on Wednesday, Oct. 10, 2012, during PACER&rsquo;s Sixth Annual <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/nbpm/">National Bullying Prevention Month</a>.

If you want to help end bullying in your community, make plans to take part in Unity Day. &lsquo;Attend&rsquo; and &lsquo;Share&rsquo; the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/314141468640954/">Unity Day Facebook Event</a> with family and friends so everyone can &lsquo;Make it Orange and Make it End!&rsquo; this October. <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/nbpm/unity-day.asp">More</a></p>
              <h3><strong>PACER Provides Colorful Ways to Get Involved</strong></h3>
              <p>Bullying is no fun but learning about it can be. One of the most popular resources available for elementary school children (pre-K to 3rd grade) is the &ldquo;Color the Crew&rdquo; <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/resources/toolkits/activities/coloring-book.asp">coloring book</a>, which gives teachers and students a wonderful opportunity to talk about bullying while they have fun. Each page includes an important message about respecting others, valuing differences, and being a friend. This is just one of many <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/getinvolved/">tools</a> from PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center that you can use to become involved in bullying prevention.  </p>
              <h3><strong>Learn the Facts About Bullying of Students with Disabilities</strong></h3>
              <p>It&rsquo;s a fact: Children with disabilities are much more likely to be bullied than their non-disabled peers. One study indicates that 60 percent of students with disabilities report being bullied regularly compared with 25 percent of all students. Most research reveals that children with disabilities are two to three times more likely to be bullied. Parents, students, and educators can learn more by reading the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/resources/students-with-disabilities/">Top 10 Facts</a> on Bullying and Harassment of Students with Disabilities,&rdquo; which includes links to a multitude of valuable <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/resources/students-with-disabilities/">resources</a>.</p>
              <h3><strong>President Obama Endorses Legislation on Bullying</strong></h3>
              <p>President Barack Obama has officially endorsed the proposed federal Student Non-Discrimination Act (SNDA) and the Safe Schools Improvement Act (SSIA), which would target discrimination and bullying against students based on their sexual orientation and gender identity. The &ldquo;Bully&rdquo; movie was shown at the White House in April to key Obama Administration staff, including Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/04/20/ending-bullying-our-schools-communities">More</a> </p>
              <h3><strong>Teens Tune In to the Power of Music</strong></h3>
              <p>Music is a powerful tool and teens are using it to amplify the bullying prevention message. The music video for Keenan West&rsquo;s song &ldquo;Never Ever&rdquo; includes 40 youth from an Ohio middle school, who drew on their own experiences with bullying to make the video more realistic. &ldquo;It was so rewarding to see how they related and responded to the song&rsquo;s message,&rdquo; says West, who is donating 50 cents from every digital download of the song to PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center. &ldquo;I was one of the kids in school standing on the sidelines and what I realize now is that I was just as wrong as the bullies themselves. We need to make it cool to stand up to bullying.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/getinvolved/student-action/events/2012-Never-Ever-Video.asp">More</a></p>
              <h3><strong>Alternative Rocker Comes Through for the Cause</strong></h3>
              <p>Supporters everywhere are coming up with unique and creative ways to raise money for bullying prevention. Indie Music Channel Award winner Melia Maccarone and her alternative rock band played a concert in Rochester, N.Y., and donated all of the proceeds to PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center. Melia was bullied in both middle school and high school, but music has helped her discover the positives of being different. She staged the show as a way to help other kids who have experienced bullying. Are you doing something original to contribute to the cause?

              <p>&ldquo;If one person takes a stand against bullying, others will follow,&rdquo; Tami writes on <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/stories/">PACER.org/bullying</a>. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take a stand together and let our voices be heard. Let&rsquo;s be the voice for those who are afraid to talk and let&rsquo;s be the voice for those who were silenced and cannot talk.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/stories/">Read more</a> creative contributions and offer one of your own – a video, story, poem, artwork, or audio clip that expresses how you feel about bullying and its impact on the world around you.
