<h2>The Cat in the Hat for President</h2>
<p>The Cat in the Hat has launched a presidential campaign and will represent all that Dr. Seuss believed about children — that they have the intellect, imagination and power to impact our world positively, while also having fun doing so. </p>
<p>The Cat in the Hat wants to show kids that every vote counts and every voice matters. On the ballot are his supporters and their causes, including &ldquo;kindness for all&rdquo; sponsored by PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center. The organization with the most votes by Election Day, Nov. 8, receives a $10,000 donation. <a href="http://www.catinhat4prez.com/">Vote for KINDNESS FOR ALL</a>.</p>
