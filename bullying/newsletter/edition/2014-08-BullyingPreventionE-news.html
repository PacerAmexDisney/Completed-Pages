  <h3>PACER&rsquo;s We Will Generation</h3>
  <p>Imagine the power of preventing bullying through student-to-student engagement in which students are educated, inspired, and supported to take positive action to connect with their peers. Students play a powerful role in influencing their school and community culture. To help them, PACER is offering the newly redesigned We Will Generation, an innovative way to engage and inspire student leaders to prevent bullying in their schools.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.PACER.org/wewillgen">Find out more.</a></p>
  <h3>Book Club</h3>
    <p>Storytelling is one of the oldest and most effective forms of education. Stories have the power to teach, to inspire, and to connect. When students read or listen to a story, they benefit from engaging with the experiences of others and can often look at their own experiences from a different perspective. PACER's book selections are designed to encourage a new generation to recognize that bullying can be overcome through education, compassion, and unity.

  <h3>Video Inspired by 12-year-old who is Passionate About Bullying</h3>
    <p><em>Because These Kids Are </em>is a 10-minute dramatic film from the heart of 12-year-old actress Izabela Vidovic. While at a park, a young artist sees a bullying situation unfold in front of her and those involved become the muses for her work. When the person bullying suddenly targets her, she surrenders her pictures to him, opening his eyes to the truth behind who he and these kids really are. <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/classroom/middle-highschool/student/because-these-kids-are.asp">Watch the video.</a></p>
  <h3>Sharing Your Story</h3>
    <p><em>&quot;I have bullied people before for what they look like or how smart they are. But I learned bullying just makes others feel sad. At that time I didn't know how it felt to be all alone and to walk into school feeling scared. Also I lost my best friend in 5th grade because we got into a fight and it was all my fault. Then it spread through my school and that's when I felt all alone and I realized how I made others feel. Throughout the rest of the school year I was so stressed out and I was taking my stress out on other kids that didn't do anything. I want to help all the bullies stop and not lose their best friend like I did. I want to be a social worker when I grow up and share my story and help kids get through it. I would really love to change the world.&quot;</em></p>
