 <h2 align="center">BULLYING PREVENTION E-NEWS</h2>
<h3><strong>What Will You Do for PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Month?</strong></h3>
<p>This October, raise awareness during PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Month by reaching out to your school or community, or by making a personal commitment to prevent bullying. Big events, small acts of kindness – they all contribute to a powerful movement to show targets of bullying that they are not alone. Everyone can do something, somewhere, somehow. Maybe you can organize a Unity Day event at your school or attend a Run, Walk, Roll Against Bullying in your community. Maybe you&rsquo;ll make a commitment to invite a student who looks lonely to sit with you at lunch, or to say something kind to each of your classmates. Whatever you do to take part in National Bullying Prevention Month, you will be helping to build a kinder and safer community for everyone.  <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/nbpm/"><strong>Learn more.</strong></a></p>
<h3><strong>Oct. 9 is Unity Day: Time to Make it Orange, Make it End!</strong></h3>
<p>Unity Day is a day on which everyone comes together in solidarity with those who have experienced bullying, to &ldquo;Make it Orange, Make it End.&rdquo; On Wednesday, Oct. 9, individuals, schools, businesses, and communities across the country will unite to show their support for bullying prevention. By wearing orange on Unity Day, you can demonstrate your commitment to building inclusive and supportive communities. Come up with your own unique way to show your &ldquo;orange pride&rdquo; or choose one of PACER&rsquo;s exciting Unity Day activities.<a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/nbpm/unity-day.asp"><strong>Learn more.</strong></a></p>
<h3><strong>PACER and CustomInk Invite You to &lsquo;Be Good To Each Other&rsquo;</strong></h3>
   <p>PACER is pleased to partner with CustomInk, the &ldquo;design online&rdquo; custom T-shirt company, as part of its &ldquo;Be Good to Each Other&rdquo; campaign. The campaign takes a stand for kindness and tolerance and uses the power of custom T-shirts to do good.&nbsp;<strong>All profits from this partnership support the work of PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center. </strong>You can support PACER (and look good doing it!) in three different ways: order the official Unity Day T-shirt, order a celebrity T-shirt design, or create your own custom design. No matter which option you choose, you can wear your shirt with pride as you commit to &ldquo;Be Good to Each Other!&rdquo; <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/nbpm/unity-day-t-shirt.asp"><strong>Learn more. </strong></a></p>
<h3><strong>Take Part in a Run, Walk, Roll Against Bullying in Your Community</strong></h3>
   <p>Communities across the country will host Run, Walk, Roll Against Bullying events throughout October. PACER&rsquo;s flagship event will take place on Saturday, Oct. 5 at Normandale Lake Park in Bloomington, Minn., and will include a 4-mile run or a 1.5-mile walk/roll plus entertainment, activities, and lots of fun! Elsewhere in the country, communities are being creative. In Flushing, Ohio, the Think Before You Speak organization is hosting a 1.6-mile obstacle course where participants have to learn about bullying in order to get through the course. Find an event near you or host your own with PACER&rsquo;s easy-to-use toolkit! <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/nbpm/runwalkroll/events-around-the-country.asp"><strong>Learn more. </strong></a></p>
<h3><strong>Everyone&rsquo;s Contribution Matters</strong></h3>
   <p>You can make a difference. Schools, organizations, parents, and students each play a role in addressing bullying prevention. Every contribution, no matter how small, makes a difference. You could host a community event, speak up for someone who is being bullied, or donate to PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center – anything that says you recognize bullying as a problem and you want to do something about it. <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/getinvolved/contributions/"><strong>More ideas to get involved </strong></a></p>
<h3><strong>Here&rsquo;s what Kyle Kleiboeker of the USA network show &ldquo;Summer Camp&rdquo; did</strong></h3>
     <p><em>Accept no one&rsquo;s definition of your life; define yourself</em><br />
  &ldquo;Growing up in a small town, I always knew I was unique. Instead of playing T-Ball, I wanted to be in dance class. Instead of playing at recess, I was designing costumes for my future &ldquo;Sold Out World Tour.&rdquo; I can vividly remember at 7 years old performing for just about anyone who would watch me. It wasn't until 2nd Grade when I was &ldquo;The New Kid&rdquo; at school that I realized bullying existed. I danced in my school talent show and from that moment on my life would never be the same. I performed in a purple sequined jacket with matching purple biker shorts. The guys teased me because &lsquo;dancing was for girls&rsquo; and the girls teased me because &lsquo;boys play soccer.&rsquo; <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/getinvolved/contributions/"><strong>Read more and watch the video.</strong></a></p>
<h3><strong>Share Your Story with Others</strong></h3>
     <p>After dealing with bullying in and out of school, 10-year-old Hanna started A Community For Change on Facebook. She wants to make a positive difference in her community and in the lives of her peers. On May 14, 2013, the Prospect Park Borough Council passed two bully-free resolutions which Hanna presented, making her hometown in suburban Philadelphia a “bully-free community” and a “compassionate borough.” These same resolutions are being introduced in Tyrone Borough, Penn. Hanna’s goal is to have every town in Pennsylvania to become bully-free and for every school district to reevaluate their procedures and implement bullying awareness programs. “Be the change you wish to see in the world” are words she wants everyone to live by. <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/stories/?id=367">Learn more about Hannah’s project.</a></p>
