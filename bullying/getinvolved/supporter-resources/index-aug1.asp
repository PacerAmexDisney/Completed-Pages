The two mamas behind Fox and Trove go one step further and also teach this age group how to be brave because kids who stand up for themselves and others effectively are far less likely to be targets of bullying.

    <p>August Pullman was born with a facial deformity that, up until now, has prevented him from going to a mainstream school. Starting 5th grade at Beecher Prep, he wants nothing more than to be treated as an ordinary kid&mdash;but his new classmates can't get past Auggie's extraordinary face. <strong>WONDER</strong> by R.J. Palacio begins from Auggie's point of view, but soon switches to include his classmates, his sister, her boyfriend, and others. These perspectives converge in a portrait of one community's struggle with empathy, compassion, and acceptance. In a world where bullying among young people is an epidemic, this is a refreshing new narrative full of heart and hope. R.J. Palacio has called her debut novel &quot;a meditation on kindness&quot;&mdash;indeed, every reader will come away with a greater appreciation for the simple courage of friendship. Auggie is a hero to root for, a diamond in the rough who proves that you can&rsquo;t blend in when you were born to stand out.</p>

   <p><strong>About: Spookley the Square Pumpkin and Holiday Hill Farm</strong> <br />
    <em>The Legend of Spookley the Square Pumpkin, </em>written and created by Joe Troiano, tells the story of a square pumpkin living in a round pumpkin patch on Holiday Hill Farm. Spookley faces ridicule from his patch-mates but overcomes this when he saves the patch from being destroyed by a terrible storm. All the pumpkins in the patch learn that the things that make you different are the things that make you special. </p>
   <p>    The animated classic <em>Spookley the Square Pumpkin</em>, which was adapted from the book, will air again this October on the Disney Channel in the US and abroad.&nbsp; The <em>Spookley</em> story is also available as an app for the iPad/iPhone, Android and Nook platforms. &nbsp; <em>Spookley</em> lives on <em>Holiday Hill Farm</em>, a world of story-telling magic that is also the setting for Joe Troiano&rsquo;s storybook classics <em>Mistletoe and the Christmas Kittens, Lyla the Lovesick Ladybug, JellyBean the Unbreakable Egg </em>and <em>Beacon the Bright Little Firefly</em>.&nbsp; </p>
   <p class="note">5% of 2011 proceeds received by Holiday Hill from The Legend of Spookley the Square Pumpkin books will be donated to PACER</p></td></tr>
