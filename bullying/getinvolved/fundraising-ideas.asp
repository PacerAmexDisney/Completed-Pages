	<p>You are asking and PACER  is listening! PACER recognizes and values   the generosity of people who make a personal and meaningful contribution   to the cause. It is in that spirit that we share a few creative   fundraising ideas that have come from students, organizations, and   schools &ndash; along with a few of our own.</p>
	<p>Remember, when you hold a fundraiser, be sure to let people know   that the proceeds from your activity are being donated to PACER&rsquo;s   National Bullying Prevention Center.</p>
	<h3>Sales</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Orange ribbons</strong> &mdash; Orange is the color of bullying   prevention. We encourage you to wear orange during National Bullying   Prevention Month in October and beyond. One easy way to do this is to   create orange ribbons. Visit your local fabric store, buy a spool of   orange ribbon, and cut it into 18-inch strips, or simply use orange   construction paper. </li>
		<li><strong>Oranges</strong> &mdash; Ask your local grocer to &nbsp;donate (or discount) oranges and offer them to supporters in return for a donation. </li>
		<li><strong>Wristbands</strong> &mdash; Purchase orange silicon   wristbands, customize them with &lsquo;TeensAgainstBullying.org,&rsquo; &lsquo;The End of   Bullying Begins With Me,&rsquo; or &lsquo;I Care About Bullying Prevention.&rsquo; Sell   them at school events.</li>
		<li><strong>Orange swag</strong> &mdash; Purchase inexpensive orange items,   such as shirts, basketballs, hats, socks or shoelaces. Encourage   everyone to purchase, along with extra donation to PACER&rsquo;s National   Bullying Prevention Center.</li>
		<li><strong>Temporary Tattoos</strong> &mdash; Purchase tattoos, that can be adhered (and easily removed), which reflect themes of diversity, acceptance, and kindness.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Contests</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>School T-shirt</strong> &mdash; Hold a T-shirt design contest.   Ask people to vote for the winning design. Create an order form. Set the   price for more than the cost of the shirts. Encourage people to   preorder. When there are several orders, get the shirts printed. If   there are extra T-shirts, sell them for a profit, and contribute the   proceeds. </li>
		<li><strong>Unity Posters</strong> &mdash; Hold a contest to create   UNITY posters. Request a small contribution from each participant and   ask local businesses to donate prizes. The poster could include artwork,   poetry, writing, or a combination of all three. Have a committee select   the top three and award the prizes. </li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Community</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Unity Banner</strong> &mdash; Create a huge banner with the word   UNITY as the central theme. Ask everyone to make a voluntary   contribution to sign the banner, define what unity means to them, or   make a suggestion about ways to unite as a school or organization. </li>
		<li><strong>Pajama Day</strong> &mdash; Sell tickets for the right to wear pajamas to school one day.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Raffles</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Orange shoe raffle</strong> &mdash; Ask a local running store to   donate a pair of orange athletic shoes. The shoes can be symbolic,   representing a $50 or $100 gift certificate, and tickets can be raffled   for $1 to $5 using the slogan &ldquo;Will you take the first step to prevent   bullying?&rdquo;</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Events</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Birthday party</strong> &mdash; It&rsquo;s your birthday but instead   of having guests bring presents, ask them to make a donation to the   National Bullying Prevention Center. </li>
		<li><strong>Concert</strong> &mdash; Hold a concert (vocal or band) and charge admission or ask guests to donate to PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center </li>
		<li><strong>3-on-3 basketball tournament</strong> &mdash; Host a 3-on-3 basketball tournament and contribute the proceeds. </li>
		<li><strong>Kick ball tournament</strong> &mdash; Stage a fun, engaging kick ball tournament and donate the entrance fees.</li>
		<li><strong>Sporting event</strong> &ndash; Ask your school if you can dedicate a home game to bullying prevention. Sell orange T-shirts to have an &ldquo;orange out&rdquo; at the game, and donate the proceeds to PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center. Have fans sign a banner at the game to show their support for bullying prevention. Ask team members to wear orange armbands, socks, or even use an orange ball. Be sure to make an announcement at the game! <a href="http://www.southernminn.com/le_center_leader/news/article_4ec86d37-6712-58cd-9f1b-989bbfb2a123.html" target="_blank">Here&rsquo;s a great example.</a></li>
