			<h2>What You Can Do</h2>
			<p><strong><em>Are you experiencing bullying?</em></strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Middle and High School<p>Drama. Bullying. Teasing. Harassment. No matter what you call it, it hurts. If you’re pushed, hit, or your things are ripped off or trashed, it can hurt physically. If you’re ignored by friends or cruel things are posted about you online, it can hurt emotionally. If it happens to you, you’ve probably asked yourself, “Why me?” You know how painful it is to be treated this way.<br /> <a href="http://www.pacerteensagainstbullying.org/tab/experiencing-bullying/" target="_blank">So seriously, what can you do? A lot!</a></p></li>
			<!--jeff -is there a way to hyperlink direct to this section on the page?-->
			<li>Elementary School<p>Not sure what bullying is? Or if it’s happening to you? Don’t worry, lots of kids wonder about that!<br /> <a href="http://www.pacerkidsagainstbullying.org/kab/are-you-a-target/" target="_blank">Learn what you can do.</a></p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong><em>Have you seen bullying and want to help?</em></strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Middle and High School<p>Have you ever seen bullying happen and thought, "I wish there was a way that I can help, but I just don't know what to do?" You can help! In fact, when peers intervene and help someone being bullied, that's really powerful!<br /> <a href="http://www.pacerteensagainstbullying.org/tab/experiencing-bullying/" target="_blank">Learn what you can do.</a></p></li>
			<li>Elementary School<p>Bullying doesn’t affect just those who are bullied and those who bully, it has a huge impact on those who see the behavior! The group of kids who witness bullying is really important. This group may not be getting bullied, they may not be bullying, but their reaction can make a big difference.<br />
