				<p><strong>Aija, a dynamic communicator and compelling speaker on the subject of bullying, is touring schools fall of 2015 to speak to students from 4th -12th grade.</strong></p>
                <p>Aija Mayrock is not your typical college student. After being personally victimized for about 8 years and hearing of a teen's suicide due to bullying, Aija was 16 when she decided to take action. She wrote and self-published a book titled The Survival Guide to Bullying. Now the 19-year-old's not-so-little book has been published by Scholastic and together they are setting out to help kids around the world and to erase the stigma attached to being bullied.</p>

			<p><strong>Aija is a writer and activist. Her dream is to give a voice to the voiceless through art.</strong></p>
 
			<p>Starting from page one of “The Survival Guide to Bullying,” teenage writer, Aija, captures your attention! She writes,</p>
 
			<p style="padding-left:100px"><em>Bullying was the dark cloud over my head.<br />
			The voices of the kids who bullied me were the raindrops<br />
			that flooded my day. And their hateful glares were the<br />
			lightning bolts that I tried my best to dodge.<br />
			I didn’t realize how much bullying had taken over my<br />
			life until my family and I moved across the country at the<br />
			end of 8th grade.<br /></em></p>
			 
			<p style="padding-left:100px"><em>I realized how much I had been suffering, but I also<br />
			realized how strong I was. I started writing poems,<br />
			screenplays, and stories. I put all of my pain into my<br />
			work. I had finally found this incredible outlet. And<br />
			through this outlet, I found my first mission in life.<br />
			I knew that there were millions of kids all over the<br />
			world suffering in silence from bullying. In my sleep, I<br />
			could feel their fear, their helplessness, and their pain. I<br />
			dreamed of a way that I could help them and show them<br />
			that they weren’t alone in their battle.<br /></em></p>
			 
			<p>Aija started writing “The Survival Guide to Bullying” when she was 16 years old and finished it in 2015, at 19 years old. Aija promised herself that she would publish this book as a gift to the next generation of kids that would be bullied. She self-published this book in October of 2014 and one month later, Scholastic acquired it. Aija dealt with bullying for many years, beginning in the 3rd grade. In the midst of these very difficult times, Aija discovered her creativity and passion. She wrote her very first screenplay on the day of the deadline for the Santa Barbara International Film Festival 10-10-10 competition. She won the competition and from that time forth pursued her passions. She has also won awards from the Scholastic Art and Writing Competition for her writing and poetry. Aija will be speaking about her book and bullying to schools around the U.S. this year. She is currently a student at New York University. </p>
