    <p>My name is Olivia Pierce. I am 14 and in the 8th grade. When I was in kindergarten, I struggled with a learning disorder and acted out in class due to frustration. The other kids saw I was different and would bully me. No matter what I did after that, the kids never accepted me. With some help from my parents and teachers, things got better for me academically, but I was still bullied and didn’t have many friends. Luckily, I was able to turn to my parents for help. You should always tell your parents or another adult if you are bullied.</p>
    <p>I’ve been told I have thick skin, because I kept trying to make new friends even though it felt like I would never have any. In middle school, I finally have some good friends and they do not judge me based upon my behavior in Kindergarten. Because of my experience, I go out of my way to make kids feel accepted and I do not judge them because they are different. Now I have a lot of friends who support me in my stopping bullying effort and they accept me for who I am because I accept everyone for who they are. I don’t care what other people think of them because, to me, everyone is special on the inside no matter what they are on the outside.</p>
    <p>A year ago, I launched the &ldquo;Raise Your Crown Against Bullying&rdquo; initiative to help show other kids that are bullied that they are not alone. I also spend a lot of my volunteer time being an advocate for bullying prevention causes. I want every kid out there to know that bullying can happen to anyone, even adults. It is wrong, and everybody should be treated kindly.</p>
    <p>As a result of my volunteering this past year, I earned The Gold President’s Volunteer Service Award for completing 125 hours of community service. That was such an honor. Some of my bullying prevention activities include The Faces of Change — The Youth Advisory Board of PACER’s National Bullying Prevention Center, PACER’s Run Walk and Roll Against Bullying, and advocating through my own nonprofit &ldquo;Raise Your Crown Against Bullying.&rdquo; Learn more  on my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/raiseyourcrownagainstbullying" target="_blank">Facebook page</a>.</p>
