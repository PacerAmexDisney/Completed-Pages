    <h2>Third Grade Students Create an Original Music Video with a Positive Message</h2>

    <p>The third  graders at People for People Charter School in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania began  discussing bullying prevention on the very first day of school. We decided in  September to create a song about bullying, after school administration  presented the entire student body with an entrepreneurship challenge to develop  a business plan. The third grade team joined forces and&nbsp; began discussing  ideas for a plan that would not only be a learning experience for our  classes, but also very fun! </p>
    <p>    	We wanted the  song to deliver a positive message in a way that students and adults would  understand. Bullying is such a huge problem in schools all across the United  States. The effects of bullying can lead to emotional scarring and in some  cases even death. The news is filled with stories about bullying and school  violence. We wanted to create a bullying prevention tool that defined what  bullying is, and of course delivers a strong message about it being wrong.</p>
    <p>    	On Friday,  October 5, 2012, Mrs. Logan, a third grade teacher, traveled to Hidden Beatz  Recording Studio with a total of 15 students. The students worked very hard to  perfect their very own lyrics, and they managed, after many practices in the  recording booth, to create the verses for a wonderful masterpiece called, STOP!  Sania J., a 3rd grader in Mrs. Logan&rsquo;s class, sang the chorus with  such a powerful, well-polished voice!</p>
    <p>    	All three  classes traveled to the park two weeks later to shoot scenes for a video after  we received tons of positive feedback about the song. Mrs. Logan and Sania J.  met on two consecutive Saturdays with the video production team to film scenes  at the school and nearby at a local playground. </p>
    <p>    	We are  confident that our project will serve as a mirror to anyone who is bullying and  will hopefully encourage him/her to make positive changes.&nbsp; We also hope  that it provides comfort and understanding for a student currently being  tormented by a bully. The third grade students and teachers at the People for  People Charter School know how it feels to be bullied, and WE CARE!!</p>
