Back in September, I  began working on a way for our school to provide a positive voice against the  issue of bullying in schools. As you are aware, bullying has become a huge  problem in our schools. The effects of bullying can be serious and even fatal.  The news is filled with stories linking bullying and school violence. Studies  have shown that children who are bullied can harbor violent thoughts, suffer  from severe depression, and even commit suicide. I wanted to create a tool that  can be used to fight bullying and to send a message that bullying is not only  wrong, but it is unacceptable.</p>
    <p>On Wednesday, March 28, after months of planning and  coordinating, it all came together when our student body created an original  &quot;LipDub&quot; video with a strong anti-bullying message. A LipDub is a  type of music video that is filmed in one continuous shot. Our goal was to  create a message against bullying from teenagers, but to not make it so  &quot;heavy&quot; that other teenagers would not pay attention to it. </p>
    <p>One of our students , Kaitlyn Knippers, wrote the  fun, upbeat, original song about bullying. Our drama club created a short skit  that is used as an intro and close for the video to help add to the story and  the message. Our Production Team did a wonderful job of coordinating with all  the groups, making signs and banners, choreographing the actions for each group  and about fifty other things that no one else even realized they did. Preston  Cox, a senior at our school, filmed and edited our video in which over 1,000  students from all of our various clubs, groups, teams, and general student body  participated and supported our message that bullying is not acceptable.</p>
<p>We genuinely believe our finished product provides a powerful  message against bullying and can serve as a useful tool against this terrible  problem, particularly because the message comes from other teenagers.</p>
