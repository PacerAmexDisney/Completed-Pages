    <td valign="top"><h3>Raise The 5 Percent</h3>
      <p>Technology has led to new ways for people to bully each other, it’s called cyberbullying. Kids of all ages are constantly on social media websites boasting their opinion about whatever, and whoever they want to. There has always been that one person on the internet that feels they need to make others feel bad. I would know – as I was one of those targeted. I was constantly harassed and at times threatened over social media. <a href="/bullying/getinvolved/student-action/events/2015-Raise_The_5Percent.asp">Read more.</a></p></td>

      <p>My name is Olivia Pierce. I am 14 and in the 8th grade. When I was in kindergarten, I struggled with a learning disorder and acted out in class due to frustration. The other kids saw I was different and would bully me. No matter what I did after that, the kids never accepted me. With some help from my parents and teachers, things got better for me academically, but I was still bullied and didn’t have many friends. Luckily, I was able to turn to my parents for help.  <a href="/bullying/getinvolved/student-action/events/2015-Raise_Your_Crown.asp">Read more.</a></p></td>

<td><h3>Hear the Silence</h3>
<p>I have been interested in helping people all of my life and was aware of friends around me being bullied so I decided to look up statistics and was alarmed with the epidemic numbers.  So I reached out to PACER’s National Bullying Prevention Center and was granted permission to produce a Public Service Announcement entitled “Hear the Silence” for my Girl Scout Gold Award.  The goal was to get a perspective of a mother and daughter, as well as the viewpoint of someone who had bullied.  I discovered in my interviews that several years ago, I was a participant of bullying and wanted to interweave my personal experience into the story.   I hoped to bring attention from all angles of bullying and hope my story will help others combat peer pressure, to recognize if they are being bullied, and to get help.</p>
  <p>I discovered a lot about myself, and how we all struggle with finding our voice and learning how to be strong and empowered. I apologized to the mother and daughter and we remain good friends.  My advice, reach out and speak out so you can be part of the solution, not the problem.  To quote Alexander Pope, to err, is human but to forgive, is divine!</p>

<td><h3>Sew for SOS</h3>
<p>While facing a frightening surgery on his arm, 12 year old Luke started thinking about the many other people in the world facing difficult life events, like illness or bullying. He decided he wanted to let them know that someone cared about them. So he started an initiative called SEW for SOS, where students spend some of the recess periods sewing miniature pillows with inspirational messages stuffed inside. Then they send these pillows to people they believe need support – patients, veterans, and other students.</p>
  <p>Luke writes, &ldquo;It is important to me because I want to express the fact that even though I am a kid, that I can make a positive change in my community. That desire to make a difference even at a young age is what pushes me to work extremely hard every day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Luke and the other members of SEW for SOS are living proof that you’re never too young to make a difference in your community!</p>

<p>In May 2014, the students of <a href="http://www.visitation.net/page.cfm?p=520" target="_blank">VISTA Productions</a> (the joint theater program of Visitation School and Saint Thomas Academy) put on Shrek The Musical! This vibrant, exciting show includes powerful bullying prevention messages such as embracing differences and being proud of who you are. The VISTA students collaborated with PACER to create a project that linked the show with bullying prevention themes. The students made an effort to really understand the issue and were deeply motivated to make a difference in their school. They created a beautiful display that celebrated the unique characteristics of the cast and crew; it declared “What makes us special makes us strong!”  Bullying is an issue that affects students on a deeply personal level, but it has important implications for parents, teachers, schools, and communities as well.</p>
  <p>One student writes, “Working with PACER added a depth to Shrek. It isn't just a show that made me laugh, it's a show that made me consider what it means to be comfortable with the 'fairy tale creature' I am, and not the manufactured citizen of Duloc that society asks me to be.”</p>
  <p>Bullying prevention is a community effort, and the students of VISTA Productions have shown their compassion, talent, and creativity through this project.</p>

    <p>When Olivia, Katie, and Brooke noticed bullying happening in their school, they knew they needed to take action to build a safe environment for their classmates. They wanted to provide a space where students could ask questions and tell stories about their experiences with bullying anonymously. They then respond to questions with advice about bullying with the support of their school psychologist. Through this project they&rsquo;ve been able to offer support, solidarity, and advice to their fellow students who are affected by bullying.</p>
    <p>Olivia, Katie, and Brooke write: &ldquo;We care about bullying prevention because we don&rsquo;t want anyone to feel alone and helpless in their situation. We know many other people who have gone to great lengths to stop the bullying, and we want to help support them. We believe our local website is a great action step towards the large goal of stopping bullying all together.&rdquo;</p>

And the idea for Love, Share, Care was born! <a href="http://www.lovesharecare.com" target="_blank">LoveShareCare.com</a> is a place for teen and tween girls to address cyberbullying through supportive and positive interaction. Girls can socialize, engage in online challenges to spread peace and prevent bullying, and even win prizes!</p>
    <p> Azariah writes, “My idea to create a bully free social network came about after a close friend of mine experienced the torment of being bullied. My first thought was to create a group within my school for other girls who had gone through the same thing. I soon realized that the problem was much bigger than my school. I have always had a passion for helping others and bullying stands out the most to me, which made my desire to help not only my friend but girls everywhere. I want to inspire girls to be more positive not only on social media, but also through the interactions they have face to face. I want Love Share Care to be a social place that gives girls the freedom to share their ups and downs without the fear of being teased or bullied. I hope that my efforts show girls all over the world that we can make a difference by doing kind things for others, no matter how old you are.</p>

But when she was two years old, she found her forever family and her health began to improve. Now a teenager, Sarah has made amazing progress but still struggles to make friends. So along with her sisters, she came up with the idea to make 1000 new friends by sharing gumballs with strangers. Sarah and her family attend concerts, parades, and other events where she approaches individuals, shares her story, and asks if they want to become her &ldquo;gumball friend.&rdquo; In January 2014, she reached her goal of 1000 friends – and her uncle donated $1 for each friend to charity. Sarah is now on another mission, to make another 1000 friends and continue fundraising for causes she cares about. Sometimes friendship is as simple as sharing a treat, and Sarah has now touched over 1000 people with her story.

Last year, when I was in Grade 5, I started an anti bullying club at  Belfountain Public School.  I also involved local businesses and the community.  Sadly because of having Aspergers I would get bullied at school.  Many other kids get bullied as well.  I started the club to help all kids that were getting bullied. With the help of some of my classmates, my Principal, and my family we quickly had a website, and raised money to buy anti bullying t shirts. We sold 200 t shirts  using to profits to bring in groups to the school and talk to us about bullying. The Club got a lot of attention, we have had inquiries from other Schools in Ontario, United States and even Australia.</p>
      <p>Every student at Belfountain, signed a pledge not to bully making our School the only bully free school in Ontario.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yore Story&rdquo; is a documentary that has been in the works for over a year now. The film was produced by Illinois State University students. It addresses the issue of bullying in schools and online, and the traumatic effects in can have on kids and their families, by remembering the tragic story of Jessica Yore. Jessica Yore was a local high school student from Waukegan, who chose to take her own life two years ago because she felt she had no other way out. Perhaps even just as tragic as her suicide itself, was how preventable it was, and the lack of reaction to it. This kind of cruelty should never be tolerated, and something like this should never have to happen to anyone else ever again. This documentary explores the issues of bullying by remembering a beautiful life. We will be premiering the documentary on Saturday, July 20th at 7pm. The location is Jack Benny Center for the Arts, located at 39 Jack Benny Dr. in Waukegan Il, 60085. $5 donations will be collected at the door and all proceeds will go towards &ldquo;PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center.&rdquo; </p></td></tr>

      <p>The third  graders at People for People Charter School in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania began  discussing bullying prevention on the very first day of school. We decided in  September to create a song about bullying, after school administration presented  the entire student body with an entrepreneurship challenge to develop a  business plan. The third grade team joined forces and&nbsp; began discussing  ideas for a plan that would not only be a learning experience for our  classes, but also very fun! <a href="/bullying/getinvolved/student-action/events/2012-People-For-People-School.asp" title="Read More about the Third graders at People for People Charter School">Read More<span class="extralinktext">about the Third graders at People for People Charter School</span></a></p></td>

      <p>One YouTube viewer of the video shares <em style="font-size:.9em;">&quot;I really  don't get why this song isn't a Billboard No. 1 hit by now - and, in fact, why  this video hasn't got millions of views. I mean, South Park spoofed it  (entirely sympathetically, which is rare for Trey and Matt!), so I can't  understand why millions of people haven't done exactly what I did... searched  the video, prepared to mock it, but then totally fallen in love with it  instead! The production's cool, but the music and lyrics are easily as good as  anything in the﻿ Top 10 today. GJ, guys! </em></p></td>
