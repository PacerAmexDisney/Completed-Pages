          The Faces of Change — The Youth Advisory Boards of PACER’s National Bullying Prevention Center</strong></p>
        <p>The Unity Awards ceremony, first held in 2015, is an evening of celebration to gather and recognize those who have made a positive impact by addressing and preventing bullying &mdash; whether it&rsquo;s building awareness of bullying prevention, inspiring and empowering others to take positive action, or advocating for those who need support.</p>
        <p>Nominations come in from around the country and have included teachers who have touched the lives of students, individuals or groups who have been active in their communities, and those who simply made someone feel that they were not alone. </p>
        <p>Additionally, <em>The Faces of Change</em> Awards are presented to individuals or groups making a difference in Minnesota, where PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center is located, and in the Los Angeles area, where NBPC maintains an office. </p>

          <h3>Leah Fuda, Halle West, and Alexis Zara – Students from York, South Carolina</h3>
          <img src="/bullying/getinvolved/images/unityawardbios/leahHalleAlexis.jpg" width="333" height="250" alt=""/>
          <p>“Three students from our high school DECA organization took the lead to bring attention to bullying prevention in our community! They planned, organized and carried out a ‘Bigger than Bullying’ 5K run in November as a part of our school district kick-off for bullying prevention. More than 150 participants from our small, rural community came together to support this effort! This very successful 5K brought attention to the issue of bullying, but also was a way to bring together community businesses who were sponsors, parents and students who were participants, along with others who now are aware of the bullying prevention program in our school district.</p>
          <p>Starting from ‘scratch,’ these students began planning in early September to make this event happen. There was a long list of things to consider: PR, registration, setting entrance fees, ordering wristbands and t-shirts for participants, securing sponsors and other prizes. All of this in addition to finding a location and learning how to conduct a 5K including timing, signs, setting a course, water and snacks at the finish plus a thousand other little details! It was impressive to watch the planning progress and very rewarding to see the event come together — even on a very cold November morning!</p>
          <p>At the conclusion of the 5K, the proceeds were donated to the school district’s bullying prevention program in a special presentation at the December School Board meeting. These funds were used to purchase materials in support of the bullying prevention program at York Middle School and York One Academy. These three students learned so much from planning the 5K, but also highlighted the importance of bullying prevention to everyone in our community.”</p>

          <h3>Abby Belcher – Student from Rowlett, Texas</h3>
          <img src="/bullying/getinvolved/images/unityawardbios/abbyBelcher.jpg" width="175" height="250" alt=""/>
          <p>“Abby created ‘Abby’s Pledge’ when she was just 9 years old, after her sister who has Asperger’s was bullied ruthlessly by school cheerleaders. This is a pledge that she created to help encourage other people to stand up against bullying. Abby travels across the country to share her story with others and to show that no matter how young a person is, they can make a real difference. She attends training sessions that are usually reserved for social workers, police officers and counselors just so she can learn different ways to help others to stand up against bullying. (It was at one if these events that I met her.) Thousands of people across the country have taken her pledge and she has volunteer supporters (including me) across the country who help spread her message to stand up against hate. She has created a website that people can go on which houses resources parents can use to get help from other sources, and she also helps to give kids the tools and provides lifeline numbers if they are depressed. Abby came to talk to our group about bullying and we took her pledge. Abby consistently puts others before herself. She is even working on a new bill that she hopes to present to congress this year. Abby also created a campaign called the ‘Be Brave Backpack’ drive for which she distributes new backpacks filled with school supplies to kids living in domestic violence or homeless shelters so they don’t have to go to school and get bullied by others because they lack supplies. She also created the ‘Brave the Elements’ hats, gloves and sandwich drive which she went out and fed the homeless in places most would not dare to travel. She mows other people’s grass, pulls weeds and does chores in the community to help raise money for her cause. She is humble and an inspiration to all. And, she also became a school cheerleader to help break the stereotypes that cheerleaders are mean. But most of all, she is living her pledge to ‘Notice and take action’ daily, proving that no matter what the circumstance, anyone can make a real difference in their community.”</p>
          <p><em>—Nominated by Donna Smith</em></p>
          <p>“Abby is a young lady I met when we started our Anti-Bullying crusade. Knowing her and seeing her passion about bullying prevention motivated me to push our campaign even harder. She motivates all she comes in contact with, and she doesn’t take bullying lightly. Abby founded her own organization and travels with her own money to talk about bullying. This young lady is REMARKABLE! She speaks with a passion and continues her fight against bullying.”</p>

          <p>Addison, Ava, Jordyn, Teagan, and Nora, students at John Adams Middle School, wanted to brighten everyone’s day by spreading messages of hope and encouragement. Together, these 6th grade girls cut out a ton of shapes, using post-it notes, and wrote kind things on them. They then stuck 1400 notes on every student’s locker. It took the girls over two weeks to hand write and shape the notes, with messages such as “Smile, it looks good on you” and “You are amazing in so many ways.”</p>

          <img src="/bullying/getinvolved/images/unityawardbios/alexisSaldana.jpg" width="237" height="250" alt=""/>
          <p>I would like to nominate Alexis Saldana for this or really any of the awards you offer. As this school year began Alexis was campaigning for the office of 8th grade President and she herself experienced bullying from others. Other students bullied her as they were wanting another candidate instead of her to win. This was something she had never encountered before and really was upset by the behavior of others. Instead of backing out, or ignoring it, Alexis faced the situation head on. Her speech for office included her experience and a plan for improvement. She won the election which shows most students do not agree with bullying behavior. Afterward Alexis put the experience behind her and has continued to work all year building a school environment that accepts all, includes all, and looks within each individually for what they can do. </p>

          <p>I feel like this particular individual qualifies for this award mainly because in the beginning of this school year I was really scared and shy but she helped break out of my "shell". She made me feel like I belonged and helped me with my bullying situation. In light of that, I feel that if I hadn't have told her I wouldn't have told anyone. I knew that if I told her the student bullying me would probably get mad and I didn't want that. But I knew it had to stop. She actually made him stop and he wasn't mad because she explained to him what he was doing was wrong. Now I can go to school comfortably and with ease because of her. She is the nicest person I know and she deserves recognition for all the kindness she has given.</p>

          <p>The Bay City Central Anti-Bullying Pledge Club does many things around the community, such as working on implementing PACER’s We Will Generation curriculum in its area schools, presenting an assembly to local schools, and helping others in their times of desperate need. They are working on getting funding in other schools in the state of Michigan to have this type of program. Thanks to this club, the culture at Bay City Central High School has changed drastically over the years. They are assisting its Special Olympics Michigan Chapter, Unified Champions, with their "End the R-word Week.”</p>
          <p>The BCC ABPC believes that CHANGE IS POSSIBLE! Who they are:</p>
          <p>Actually, we are not that different from you! We come from all walks of life, but we have one very important belief in common.</p>
          <p>What WE believe:</p>
          <p>• It is TIME to stand up to bullying.<br />
            • We can CHOOSE to avoid posting online or participating in anything that is meant to harm someone's reputation or self-esteem.<br />
            • It is essential to COMMIT to "think before you tweet" and "ponder before you post."</p>
          <p>The Bay City Central Anti-Bullying Pledge Club not only looks for ways to prevent bullying in our school, but we also hold assemblies at our area schools. This year’s school show is called "We Are Hopeful." Our club has presented in front of 80 transport directors across the State of Michigan. We have also spoken to many middle and high schools across the Great Lakes Bay Region.</p>

This company is made up of multiple college students, each paired with a child from the community – some with and some without disabilities. She felt it necessary to include ALL kids, as not to make anyone feel different.</p>
          <p>Bethany works hard to use kind words and loving mannerisms – even throughout the chaos of trying to teach dance with so many energetic children. She is also an elementary special education major at UNI, and plans to spend her entire lifetime working on inclusiveness. She is still so young, and such an amazing and deserving advocate who has already made such big strides.</p>

I have never met this child formerly, but the stories that I hear about bravery, kindness, insight, empathy, and values are impressive.</p>
          <p>One morning, his mother shared a particular story about her son standing by a peer in the lunch room when he was being ostracized by a group of John's own friends. John continued to sit with a peer in the lunch room while his own friend group actively tried to get him to abandon this other child. John was able to be assertive and withstand the peer pressure of his friends trying to influence him to alienate another child.</p>
          <p>John, when speaking to his mother, stated, "I could never do that to someone." John demonstrated outstanding moral character and kindness toward others in general, but his desire to make someone being excluded feel included is commendable.</p>

          <p>The Student Council at North Branch Area Middle School has worked very hard this year to empower every student to take a stand against bullying. This fall, they celebrated Unity Day by bringing awareness of the need for inclusion of all and the importance of empowering bystanders. Every student and staff member signed Unity Day posters that have since been put on permanent display in the hallways as a reminder of the pledge to stay united. On October 17, the entire school took a victory lap against bullying around the track, which culminated in a huge orange color cloud ‒ a symbol and reminder to "make it orange, make it end."</p>
          <p>From there, the group created a Student Shout-Out board in the hall and took the responsibility of maintaining it throughout the school year. Students highlight another student's positive action by submitting a shout-out form, which are posted on the board. So far, the school of 650 students have posted more than 300 student shout-outs. This has grown to include the council members posting shout-outs for staff in the mail room. To remind them of their commitment to the most challenging part of the year, all students received swag rags (handkerchiefs with the school logo) in April. They gathered in the bus corral and the student council held a unity rally. The local fire department had their cherry picker there and all students who filled out a shout-out or received one were entered in a drawing to get rides over the crowd. </p>
          <p>These efforts, combined with a great school staff and student group, have resulted in the most positive and safe student and staff climate in years, and a surge of interest in student involvement. All these activities were student council-sponsored and paid for with money they raised for the efforts.</p>

          <p>As a result, she approached the school principal and suggested sensitivity training for staff. She also initiated a peer advocacy/mentoring group in the school, which is made up of students with and without disabilities.</p>
          <p>She is a role model and leader for kindness, inclusion, and acceptance in her school and community. Her actions also demonstrate a commitment to finding solutions and building bridges between community members.</p>

          <p>The students enthusiastically shared articulate, insightful, and perceptive responses, providing educators and administrators with a unique perspective into the student experience.

It was used as a catalyst to develop effective, student-relevant solutions on how bullying will be addressed at their school.</p>
