        The Faces of Change — The Youth Advisory Boards of PACER’s National Bullying Prevention Center</strong></p>
      <p>The Unity Awards ceremony, first held in 2015, is an evening of celebration to gather and recognize those who have made a positive impact by addressing and preventing bullying &mdash; whether it&rsquo;s building awareness of bullying prevention, inspiring and empowering others to take positive action, or advocating for those who need support.</p>
      <p>Nominations come in from around the country and have included teachers who have touched the lives of students, individuals or groups who have been active in their communities, and those who simply made someone feel that they were not alone. </p>
      <p>Additionally, <em>The Faces of Change</em> Awards are presented to individuals or groups making a difference in Minnesota, where PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center is located, and in the Los Angeles area, where NBPC maintains an office. </p>

          <h3>Leah Fuda, Halle West, and Alexis Zara – Students from York, South Carolina</h3>
          <img src="/bullying/getinvolved/images/unityawardbios/leahHalleAlexis.jpg" width="333" height="250" alt=""/>
          <p>“Three students from our high school DECA organization took the lead to bring attention to bullying prevention in our community! They planned, organized and carried out a ‘Bigger than Bullying’ 5K run in November as a part of our school district kick-off for bullying prevention. More than 150 participants from our small, rural community came together to support this effort! This very successful 5K brought attention to the issue of bullying, but also was a way to bring together community businesses who were sponsors, parents and students who were participants, along with others who now are aware of the bullying prevention program in our school district.</p>
          <p>Starting from ‘scratch,’ these students began planning in early September to make this event happen. There was a long list of things to consider: PR, registration, setting entrance fees, ordering wristbands and t-shirts for participants, securing sponsors and other prizes. All of this in addition to finding a location and learning how to conduct a 5K including timing, signs, setting a course, water and snacks at the finish plus a thousand other little details! It was impressive to watch the planning progress and very rewarding to see the event come together — even on a very cold November morning!</p>
          <p>At the conclusion of the 5K, the proceeds were donated to the school district’s bullying prevention program in a special presentation at the December School Board meeting. These funds were used to purchase materials in support of the bullying prevention program at York Middle School and York One Academy. These three students learned so much from planning the 5K, but also highlighted the importance of bullying prevention to everyone in our community.”</p>

          <img src="/bullying/getinvolved/images/unityawardbios/abbyBelcher.jpg" width="175" height="250" alt=""/>
          <p>“Abby created ‘Abby’s Pledge’ when she was just 9 years old, after her sister who has Asperger’s was bullied ruthlessly by school cheerleaders. This is a pledge that she created to help encourage other people to stand up against bullying. Abby travels across the country to share her story with others and to show that no matter how young a person is, they can make a real difference. She attends training sessions that are usually reserved for social workers, police officers and counselors just so she can learn different ways to help others to stand up against bullying. (It was at one if these events that I met her.) Thousands of people across the country have taken her pledge and she has volunteer supporters (including me) across the country who help spread her message to stand up against hate. She has created a website that people can go on which houses resources parents can use to get help from other sources, and she also helps to give kids the tools and provides lifeline numbers if they are depressed. Abby came to talk to our group about bullying and we took her pledge. Abby consistently puts others before herself. She is even working on a new bill that she hopes to present to congress this year. Abby also created a campaign called the ‘Be Brave Backpack’ drive for which she distributes new backpacks filled with school supplies to kids living in domestic violence or homeless shelters so they don’t have to go to school and get bullied by others because they lack supplies. She also created the ‘Brave the Elements’ hats, gloves and sandwich drive which she went out and fed the homeless in places most would not dare to travel. She mows other people’s grass, pulls weeds and does chores in the community to help raise money for her cause. She is humble and an inspiration to all. And, she also became a school cheerleader to help break the stereotypes that cheerleaders are mean. But most of all, she is living her pledge to ‘Notice and take action’ daily, proving that no matter what the circumstance, anyone can make a real difference in their community.”</p>
          <p><em>—Nominated by Donna Smith</em></p>
          <p>“Abby is a young lady I met when we started our Anti-Bullying crusade. Knowing her and seeing her passion about bullying prevention motivated me to push our campaign even harder. She motivates all she comes in contact with, and she doesn’t take bullying lightly. Abby founded her own organization and travels with her own money to talk about bullying. This young lady is REMARKABLE! She speaks with a passion and continues her fight against bullying.”</p>

As a full time nurse, she never stops working. She is bringing a walk/5K run to the Duluth area. The support she has received is amazing from schools willing to work alongside her. I believe her tireless efforts sometimes may go unnoticed, however I notice and what she has taken on is amazing. Our community was lacking this in our area, and she has come forth to make a difference for everyone.”</p>

          <p>Addison, Ava, Jordyn, Teagan, and Nora, students at John Adams Middle School, wanted to brighten everyone’s day by spreading messages of hope and encouragement. Together, these 6th grade girls cut out a ton of shapes, using post-it notes, and wrote kind things on them. They then stuck 1400 notes on every student’s locker. It took the girls over two weeks to hand write and shape the notes, with messages such as “Smile, it looks good on you” and “You are amazing in so many ways.”</p>

          <p>I would like to nominate Alexis Saldana for this or really any of the awards you offer. As this school year began Alexis was campaigning for the office of 8th grade President and she herself experienced bullying from others. Other students bullied her as they were wanting another candidate instead of her to win. This was something she had never encountered before and really was upset by the behavior of others. Instead of backing out, or ignoring it, Alexis faced the situation head on. Her speech for office included her experience and a plan for improvement. She won the election which shows most students do not agree with bullying behavior. Afterward Alexis put the experience behind her and has continued to work all year building a school environment that accepts all, includes all, and looks within each individually for what they can do. </p>

          <p>I feel like this particular individual qualifies for this award mainly because in the beginning of this school year I was really scared and shy but she helped break out of my "shell". She made me feel like I belonged and helped me with my bullying situation. In light of that, I feel that if I hadn't have told her I wouldn't have told anyone. I knew that if I told her the student bullying me would probably get mad and I didn't want that. But I knew it had to stop. She actually made him stop and he wasn't mad because she explained to him what he was doing was wrong. Now I can go to school comfortably and with ease because of her. She is the nicest person I know and she deserves recognition for all the kindness she has given.</p>

          <p>The Bay City Central Anti-Bullying Pledge Club does many things around the community, such as working on implementing PACER’s We Will Generation curriculum in its area schools, presenting an assembly to local schools, and helping others in their times of desperate need. They are working on getting funding in other schools in the state of Michigan to have this type of program. Thanks to this club, the culture at Bay City Central High School has changed drastically over the years. They are assisting its Special Olympics Michigan Chapter, Unified Champions, with their "End the R-word Week.”</p>
			<p>The BCC ABPC believes that CHANGE IS POSSIBLE! Who they are:</p>
<p>Actually, we are not that different from you! We come from all walks of life, but we have one very important belief in common.</p> 
			<p>What WE believe:</p> 
			<p>• It is TIME to stand up to bullying.<br /> 
			• We can CHOOSE to avoid posting online or participating in anything that is meant to harm someone's reputation or self-esteem.<br />
			• It is essential to COMMIT to "think before you tweet" and "ponder before you post."</p> 	
<p>The Bay City Central Anti-Bullying Pledge Club not only looks for ways to prevent bullying in our school, but we also hold assemblies at our area schools. This year’s school show is called "We Are Hopeful." Our club has presented in front of 80 transport directors across the State of Michigan.

          <p>The Student Council at North Branch Area Middle School has worked very hard this year to empower every student to take a stand against bullying. This fall, they celebrated Unity Day by bringing awareness of the need for inclusion of all and the importance of empowering bystanders. Every student and staff member signed Unity Day posters that have since been put on permanent display in the hallways as a reminder of the pledge to stay united. On October 17, the entire school took a victory lap against bullying around the track, which culminated in a huge orange color cloud – a symbol and reminder to "make it orange, make it end."</p>
		<p>From there, the group created a Student Shout-Out board in the hall and took the responsibility of maintaining it throughout the school year. Students highlight another student's positive action by submitting a shout-out form, which are posted on the board. So far, the school of 650 students have posted more than 300 student shout-outs. This has grown to include the council members posting shout-outs for staff in the mail room. To remind them of their commitment to the most challenging part of the year, all students received swag rags (handkerchiefs with the school logo) in April. They gathered in the bus corral and the student council held a unity rally. The local fire department had their cherry picker there and all students who filled out a shout-out or received one were entered in a drawing to get rides over the crowd. </p>
<p>These efforts, combined with a great school staff and student group, have resulted in the most positive and safe student and staff climate in years, and a surge of interest in student involvement. All these activities were student council-sponsored and paid for with money they raised for the efforts.</p>

			<p>The students enthusiastically shared articulate, insightful, and perceptive responses, providing educators and administrators with a unique perspective into the student experience. Their willingness and courage helped guide school personnel with information that was thoughtful, authentic, and candid.

They created a program called "Bullying Bootcamp," writing all the lessons and activities, and have gone into their homerooms across the entire school to raise awareness about bullying. </p> 
			<p>They also did a school-wide celebration on Unity Day last October that had more than 300 people, including invited guests and local elected officials. Aided by their teacher, Allison Levine, they are now reviewing their entire year so they can do it again next year! </p> 
			<p>They will begin by teaching the incoming freshman class a week of "Bullying Bootcamp" this summer and continue on into the new school year. They are amazing and they should get some recognition.</p>

		<img src="/bullying/getinvolved/images/unityawardbios/ashley-bio.jpg" width="175" height="250" alt=""/>
		<p><strong>Why is bullying prevention important to you?</strong> 160,000 students miss school everyday do to the fear of being bullied, and every 7 minutes a child falls victim to bullying. People who are bullied are two times as likely to commit suicide and four times as likely to be diagnosis with clinical depression. These statistics along with my own personal experiences with being bullied are the driving force behind why I am so passionate bullying prevention.</p>
		<p><strong>Two things you want people to know about you?</strong> I have been involved with PACER's since the age of 15. Bullying prevention is not a job for me, but a way of life.</p>
		<p><strong>Advice to prevent bullying?</strong> Speak up whether you’re the one being bullied or the one witness bullying tell someone right away, so that you can stop the bullying before it goes too far. Be a friend to someone in need kindness is the greatest medicine.</p>
		<p><strong>Your story?</strong> At a very young age I began to experience the harsh reality of bullying and I became the target for kids in school. By the age of 15 I promised myself that I would no longer be a target for bullies and created a platform titled "Bullying Stops Now," where I made it my mission to inspire other youth to speak up, and that together, we could put an end to bullying. In 2011 the ugly truth of what bullying leads to if not stopped became real to me. My brother Jay committed suicide. Although hard to bare, I found the positive and allowed it to inspire me to create a new platform entitled, "Raising Hope- promoting awareness, education on bullying and suicide prevention." I now use this platform to touch lives all across the state of Minnesota by telling my story and spreading my message of hope to all that are willing to receive it.</p>

		<h3>Austin – 12th Grade</h3>
		<img src="/bullying/getinvolved/images/unityawardbios/austin-bio.jpg" width="175" height="250" alt=""/>
		<p>Bullying Prevention is important to me because I was bullied in middle school. I felt horrible and worthless because of it, and I even thought it was my fault. I later realized it was not my fault, and that I had no reason to blame myself for their action. Since then I have been standing up for others in my school and community. I do not want anyone to go through what I went through.</p> 
		<p>I live in Dothan Alabama and I am a part of my schools SADD Chapter which is the largest SADD Chapter in the US with 450 members. With SADD I have won the gold presidential volunteer service award twice in a row. This year I have already completed over 320 hours of community service in my community.</p>
		<p>I created an Anti-Bullying Campaign called i.AM. This campaign focuses on the positive in everyone's lives not the negative that the bullies try to go after. The goal of i.AM is to help others be proud of their unique qualities that make each and everyone special and wonderful. This Campaign has won a National Award last year for its unique way of going after bullying and making a difference in my community with a conference held at my school revolving around it.</p> 
		<p>My advice to preventing bullying in a school or even online is to take the bullies power away. At school ignore the bully, and tell a teacher if the person keeps coming after you. Never take the words of the bully literally those word mean nothing in the end. It is what you think of yourself that matters. At home through cyberbullying unfriend the person, block them, and you can even report them to the website officials. No one should make someone feel horrible for being who they are or being different, because different is good.</p>

		<h3>Christina – 12th Grade</h3>
		<img src="/bullying/getinvolved/images/unityawardbios/christina-bio.jpg" width="175" height="250" alt=""/>
		<p>Nine hundred weekdays, one hundred eighty weekends, five years. Imagine being a victim for that many years, months, weeks, days, hours and seconds. I was a victim of bullying. I hesitate to use that word now, but for so many years, that is how I was defined. I was privately and publicly insulted, harassed and threatened. I was told by many to “do the world a favor and disappear for good.” As a result, I suffered with mental health and self esteem issues for many years. It was unbearable. Following eighth grade, I switched to the other middle school in my city, until the two schools joined together for high school. The bullying continued and even resulted in my younger sister being bullied by the sister of the girl who bullied me. I knew it was time for change.</p> 
		<p>This is the part of my story that I love to tell, especially when I am presenting to an audience. The overwhelming sense of sorrow in the room fades away. If you listen to me speak, this is the part where you hear the confidence in my voice for the first time. This is when you can see the pain in my eyes turn into strength, passion and desire. A sophomore English project on "passion" sparked change. I began working with PACER's National Bullying Prevention Center and there I found my voice. I have spent time speaking with our state representatives at the Capitol, I testified in front of our Senate committee in support of the Safe Schools For All Bill, I participated in bullying prevention documentaries, and I have spoken to many different leadership groups, media and organizations all around the country. The feeling I get when I hear the words, “you have helped me” is truly indescribable. I have finally found a way to turn every negative thing I have endured into something positive.</p> 
		<p>I have learned so many lessons from my experiences. If I could share just one with the world it would be the importance of sharing their stories. Stories not only provide us with our own sense of comfort, but with the ability to comfort others. An author once said, “stories are the only enchantment possible, for when we begin to see our suffering as a story, we are saved.” This quote by Anais Nin shows the importance of having a story, and sets the theme for my own. My story is unique and something I am very proud to share. Finding passion in something that tore me down for years has given me incredible strength to help others. I encourage everyone who has struggled to do the same.</p>

		<p><strong>Why is bullying prevention important to you? </strong>There is no reason to make someone feel sad, worthless, inferior, or anything of the type. Each person deserves kindness, care, and respect, and we all have a responsibility to maintain a safe environment for everyone.</p>

		<h3>Jacob – 12th Grade</h3>
		<img src="/bullying/getinvolved/images/unityawardbios/jacob-bio.jpg" width="175" height="250" alt=""/>
		<p><strong>Why is bullying prevention important to you? </strong>For many years of my life I was bullied, because of this I have come to realize first hand the effects of bullying and how it harms a person. Therefore I never want any person to experience any feeling near how I felt when I was bullied. Bullying prevention is important because it is the first line of defense we have to keep kids safe from the torment of bullying. The second line is education in bullying prevention. We need to educate the students on bullying and the effects it has.</p> 
		<p><strong>Two things you want people to know about you? </strong>I want people to know that I'm here, that I am fighting, because that's all I ever need to know. All I ever needed to know was there was someone who was there for me. I want all the kids being bullied to know that I'm here to help them. I want these students to know that they are not alone. I would also like to add that I believe that orange is more than just a color it is a statement. A statement I proudly make in my orange truck.</p> 
		<p><strong>Advice to prevent bullying? </strong>My advice to prevent bullying is tell someone, talk to someone, get help. Remember you can stand up for yourself. You are stronger than you think. Remember we all want to be ourselves so that means we have to accept others and let them be who they are too.</p>
		<p>I encourage everyone to share their story, and their experiences with others. Through sharing my story I believe I have not only helped myself deal with the tormenting things that happening to me, but I have also stood up and shouted for other victims to hear "You are not alone". </p>

		<h3>Jules – 8th Grade</h3>
		<p>Jules Wagner (13) Valley View Middle School, Edina, MN</p>
		<p>Like most kids in the world we live in today, I was bullied. I had no self-confidence and no longer valued my life. I want to be the change I want to see in the world we live in today. If I am to have a son or a daughter one day, I want to be ensured that they can grow up in a society where being different isn’t frowned upon. No kid of any age should come home crying after a hard day of school of being humiliated, singled out, or abused. No kid of any age should dread going to school in the morning in fear of what may happen during the course of that day with their teachers or peers. These are things that I feared when I was just a little bit younger than I am today.</p>
		<p>I used to carry the negative words and the emotional as well as physical scars around with me day to day. Now, I carry my self confidence and passion to allow others to feel safe and welcomed at my school and every school across the world. They say everyone is created equal, but not everyone is treated equal and it has gone on for too long that differences have been shunned. I want everyone to celebrate differences and uniqueness.</p> 
		<p>My sister is my inspiration and my role model.  She was unfortunately bullied too, which breaks my heart to know that someone as amazing and beautiful and someone with such a compassionate soul as her could ever feel unwanted or unwelcomed by her peers and the adults in our community. That’s what sparked my passion. Her courage and her compassion for everyone who has felt the same as us. I now devote my time to extraordinary experiences where I advocate for bullying prevention, kindness, and self-confidence-and love. I take part in making my community a better place volunteering in my school’s special needs room, the Valley View Middle School: Student Leadership Team, and Where Everyone Belongs” Student Group and in leading my school’s Environmental Action Now! Club, also representing my school for the Edina Student Environmental Leadership Council.</p>
		<p>The reason why I take part in these groups is not only to get the satisfaction of first hand change but also benefiting the lives of kids in my community, city, and beyond for living in a better world tomorrow than the one I live in today.</p>
		<p>Love yourselves, and every other person, appreciate diversity, and stand up for not only the cause but for the outcome of future generations growing up in a world of acceptance and unity.</p>

		<img src="/bullying/getinvolved/images/unityawardbios/katie-bio.jpg" width="175" height="250" alt=""/>
		<p><strong>Why is bullying prevention important to you? </strong>I believe that bullying is such a common occurrence and affects everyone. I think that if everyone is affected by it, we should work together to eliminate it.</strong>  
		<p><strong>Two things you want people to know about you: </strong>I'm a total musical theater nerd and my whole life practically revolves around it.  Secondly, I give great advice and love helping people fix their problems!</p>
		<p><strong>Advice to prevent bullying: </strong>I know it's cliché, but treat others how you want to be treated. Also, constantly ask yourself: is it necessary? If you're about to roll your eyes at someone or gossip, ask yourself that question.  Trust me, when it comes to bullying, your answer will always without fail be "no".</p> 
		<p><strong>Story: </strong>Both my sister and I have experienced different forms of bullying, especially during elementary school.  I think that the most hurtful and prominent were the subtle types, such as non-verbal or gossip.</p>

		<h3>Madison – 11th Grade</h3>
		<img src="/bullying/getinvolved/images/unityawardbios/madison-bio.jpg" width="175" height="250" alt=""/>
		<p><strong>Why is bullying prevention important to you? </strong>As a victim myself, and a first-hand observer of the devastating impacts bullying can have on a person, I have made the commitment to do anything and everything in my power to make sure no one has to endure what I, and so many others, have had to go through.</p>
		<p><strong>Two things you want people to know about you? </strong>I spent three weeks in various Haitian Refugee Villages in the Dominican Republic last summer, and I have a passion for public speaking.</p>
		<p><strong>Advice to prevent bullying? </strong>Never stay silent. I know it may sound redundant, but until you're in a situation in which you need help, you often don't realize how hard it is to ask for it. If you're being bullied, please confide in someone who can help, and if you observe bullying taking place, please help make your school a better place by telling a teacher or other trusted adult about what's transpiring.</p> 
		<p><strong>Your story? </strong>My best friend of three years confided in me that he identified himself as transgender, which had no impact on my perception of him in any way, but others didn't seem to feel the same way; his gender identity prompted confusion and a lack of understanding from his peers and ultimately contributed to his suicide. Although this was by far the most devastating experience of my life, it's greatly shaped who I am and how I go about my life; . It also provided me with a renewed appreciation for the tireless work and passion demonstrated by the staff of PACER each and every day - I'm so honored to have the opportunity to participate in and contribute to this organization and I'm constantly amazed by the lengths they go to ensure no one endures the strain of tragedy that bullying places on an individual and on society.</p>

		<p><strong>Why is bullying prevention important to you? </strong>Bullying is a very serious and depressing issue that kids all over the world face. Any person shouldn’t have to go through these hard situations. No matter what your race, religion, size, or personality is, you shouldn’t have to be treated terribly for it. That is why I think bullying prevention is very important.</p>

		<h3>Olivia – 8th Grade</h3>
		<img src="/bullying/getinvolved/images/unityawardbios/olivia-bio.jpg" width="175" height="250" alt=""/>
		<p><strong>Why is bullying prevention important to you? </strong>I was bullied all through elementary school and I don’t want anyone to experience that kind of pain or to feel that they are all alone.</p> 
		<p><strong>Two things you want people to know about you? </strong>I started competing in natural pageants a year ago to build my self-esteem and make friends. As a result of my volunteering this past year, I earned The Gold President’s Volunteer Service Award for completing 125 hours of community service. That was such an honor.</p>
		<p><strong>Advice to prevent bullying? </strong>I have learned from talking to people that bullied me when I was younger, that there were certain things I did that triggered some of the bullying. I am not at all saying that it is my fault because bullying is never ok, but if I had known that when I was younger, maybe I could have changed the perception of my behavior.</p>
		<p><strong>Your Story? </strong>When I was in kindergarten, I struggled with a learning disorder and acted out in class due to frustration. The other kids saw I was different and would bully me. No matter what I did after that, the kids never accepted me. With some help from my parents and teachers, things got better for me academically, but I was still bullied and didn't have many friends. Luckily, I was able to turn to my parents for help. You should always tell your parents or another adult if you are bullied. </p>
		<p>I've been told I have thick skin, because I kept trying to make new friends even though it felt like I would never have any. In middle school, I finally have some good friends and they do not judge me based upon my behavior in Kindergarten. Because of my experience, I go out of my way to make kids feel accepted and I do not judge them because they are different. Now I have a lot of friends who support me in my stopping bullying effort and they accept me for who I am because I accept everyone for who they are. I don’t care what other people think of them because, to me, everyone is special on the inside no matter what they are on the outside.</p> 	
		<p>A year ago, I launched the Raise Your Crown Against Bullying initiative on Facebook and Instagram to help show other kids that are bullied that they are not alone. I also spend a lot of my volunteer time being an advocate for bullying prevention and awareness. I want every kid out there to know that bullying can happen to anyone, even adults. It is wrong, and everybody should be treated kindly. </p>

		<p><strong>Why is bullying prevention important to you? </strong>It is important to give a voice to the ones who are fearful of who will judge and bully them. There needs to be an end to bullying and I know we can help to conquer this goal.</p>
		<p><strong>Two things you want people to know about you: </strong>My mom has been a longtime volunteer at PACER and now is a worker at PACER, head of PACER benefit silent auction. I am traveling around Asia this summer for 5 weeks.</p>
		<p><strong>Advice to prevent bullying: </strong>Don’t be afraid to stand up and show your appreciation for kids being bullied. It’s completely unacceptable for kids to be bullied for who they are and no one to make a stand. It is amazing to be able to be commemorated for your actions of standing up.</p>
