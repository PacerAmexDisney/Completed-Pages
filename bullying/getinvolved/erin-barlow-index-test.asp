			<h1 id="maincontent" style="font-size:1.7em"><strong>Erin Barlow: National Ambassador and Public Speaker</strong></h1>
	

			<p>Erin Barlow is an honors student and theater major at UCLA&rsquo;s School of Theater Film and Television. She is also an educational film producer and motivational speaker. </p>
            <p>After learning of PACER&rsquo;s commitment to bullying prevention, Erin was inspired to apply her talents to this vital cause. She is now the National Ambassador, Advisory Board Member and advocate for PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center. </p>
            <p>Erin&rsquo;s experience of being bullied throughout middle school had a profound impact on her. Those experiences changed her life and inspired her to give voice to the pain of feeling alone with no place to turn. <br />
  &nbsp;<br />
              Erin now shares her powerful story and insights designed to educate, build awareness, and provide resources. Most importantly, Erin&rsquo;s mission is to let those being bullied know that they are not alone. She encourages all to seek support, talk to someone, and know that PACER is here for them. </p>

            <h3>Erin&rsquo;s video</h3>
            <p>Erin and Brandon Papo have written and produced a powerful three-minute video titled: &ldquo;Erin&rsquo;s Story: Together We Can Stop Bullying.&rdquo;</p>
            <div align="center"><iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iL6CS8s_tYM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
            <h3>Erin&rsquo;s advice</h3>
            <p>Note: The following text is excerpted from Erin&rsquo;s video</p>
              <p><em>I&rsquo;d like to start out by saying to anyone who has been bullied, please know you are not alone. I, too, know what it&rsquo;s like to be bullied and to want to give up. </em></p>
            <p><em>However, I stand in front of you today as a warrior and living proof that it can better. It&rsquo;s organizations like PACER that help kids recognize their self-worth and to trust the truth within them. </em><br />
              <em>If you have been bullied, please know you are worth fighting for. Never let others determine your self-worth. Fighting for happiness and getting help was the best decision I made. I didn&rsquo;t give up on myself and neither should you. </em></p>
            <p><em>When I decided to get help, one of the biggest lessons I learned is that I have the power of choice. I could either choose to let people&rsquo;s hurtful words affect me, or I could choose to love myself. It wasn&rsquo;t always an easy road, but once I started loving myself, the bullying stopped and I began attracting people who loved and accepted me. </em></p>
            <p><em>This may sound corny, but before I went to school, I would look at myself in the mirror and say three things I liked about myself. I also wrote down in my journal three things I was thankful for. This practice was an enormous help. The more I chose to be kind to myself and others, the more I realized how powerful I am.</em></p>
            <p><em>Every person in this room is powerful beyond belief. It&rsquo;s up to you to tap into your power and share it with the world. And know you never have to be alone again. There&rsquo;s help. I am here for you. PACER is </em><br />
              <em>here for you. </em></p>
            <p><em>Together we work as one to not only to put an end to bullying, but to change the way we interact and communicate with each other. To create environments where we have compassion and empathy for those around us. It starts here and now. With PACER on our side we cannot lose. </em></p>
