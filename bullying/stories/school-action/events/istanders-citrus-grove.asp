    <p>In 2012, Shawna Hixon and Lana Barros from Citrus Grove  Elementary in Palm City, Florida led an innovative program, &ldquo;iSTAND&rdquo;, which  they designed to creatively engage students to take action against bullying. In  an interview with Shawna, she provides information about the origin of the  initiative, what it took to be successful, and the resources for starting an  iSTANDER group at your school.</p>
    <p>    	Shawna writes<em>, &ldquo;At the end of  the 2011-2012 school year, while going over the SAC survey that students  complete every year, I was alarmed at how many students were concerned with  bullying incidents at our school.&nbsp; I thought that if it was a strong  enough feeling for them to mention it on the survey, then it was worth looking  into and investigating further.&nbsp; I had always thought of bullying being a  problem in the middle and high schools. To my surprise, it was just as big of a  problem at the elementary level.&nbsp; Unfortunately, at this level, children  do not understand that it is not okay, it does not have to happen and there is  somewhere to turn.&nbsp; I was then on a mission to bring the survey to the  attention of our administrators in hopes to start a bully awareness club at our  school.&rdquo;</em></p>
    <p>    	Shawna shared that in her research  she discovered two elements that seemed critical for success. The first was  about funding, like most schools, hers had minimal budget for new activities,  so it needed to be something that required minimal resources and financial  commitment. The second, was based on how to best engage students on the issue,  her research showed that students were more likely listen to and follow peers  rather than adults.&nbsp; With those two things in mind, she decided on an  approach that was student oriented with strong, influential peers and hands on  ideas made from scratch.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>    	The next step was to secure  permission from administration, and once she had the &ldquo;go-ahead&rdquo;, she approached  Mrs. Lana Barros for her help and support. Together, they worked on a name for  the group, ideas such &ldquo;Bully Busters&rdquo;, &ldquo;Stomp Out Bullying&rdquo;, were suggested,  but none seemed to fit. They didn&rsquo;t want students walking around like  Ghostbusters, jumping in to try to solve issues on their own or anything that  may look like we wanted students to take things into their own hands.&nbsp;  Shawna said that, &ldquo;a<em>s we were researching different ways to deal with  bullying situations that were appropriate for students of our age levels, we  noticed that a lot of scenarios encourage students to take a stand.&nbsp; To  stand up for friends who may be getting bullied, to stand up to the bully if  it&rsquo;s their self who is the target and to take a stand to spread the word about  bully awareness.&nbsp; As a result, &ldquo;iStand&rdquo; was born.&nbsp; During one of our  first meetings, I was explaining to the kids what our mission would be, which  is to promote bully awareness, so that students know others are watching and  will take steps to interject instead of standing by and letting it  happen.&nbsp; Their role would be to model positive behaviors, to encourage  others to take a stand by using the tools we discuss during our meetings and to  take a stand themselves if they see bullying either by standing up or getting  help when needed.&nbsp; Then, voila, the phrase, &ldquo;Be an iStander, not a  bystander&rdquo;, came out.&nbsp; It just fit and the students loved it.&rdquo;</em></p>
    <p>    	Now that the group had a name, they  needed activities. Shawna, knowing that they were proceeding with a budget,  went online, and this is where she found PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention  Center. On the site she found numerous resources to use with the club<em>.&nbsp; </em>She shared that<em>, &ldquo;they decided to declare a &ldquo;Bully Awareness Week&rdquo; and  include activities such as a poster contest with the theme, &ldquo;Be an iStander,  not a bystander&rdquo;, &ldquo;iStand for……….&rdquo; cards that the whole school filled out and  we displayed in the atrium while spelling out &ldquo;iStand&rdquo; with them, an &ldquo;I am  different&rdquo; chain piece to where each student wrote something on their piece  that made them different, then we linked them all together to show that we can  all be different but still respect each other and get along.&nbsp; On the last  day we had a &ldquo;Wear your favorite team&rdquo; shirt to go along with the being  different, but still being friends idea.&rdquo; </em></p>
    <p>    	The initial response from the  students was overwhelming positive and that&rsquo;s when they knew that &ldquo;iSTAND&rdquo; was  going to make a difference. </p>
    <p>    	When asked the keys to being  successful with the initiative, Shawna said, </p>
	<ul>
		<li><em>The key to bully awareness is to keep the  awareness visible.&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></li>
		<li><em>iStand does this by teaching the tools that  students can use through skits portraying actual school incidents that the  students encounter at various times of the day done by the iStand group.&nbsp; </em></li>
		<li><em>Examples would be the playground, the  cafeteria, extended day, in the hallways, in the classroom, etc.&nbsp; We get  this information by having student feedback discussions during our  meetings.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s at this time that we get to see bullying through the  student&rsquo;s eyes as well as how they feel it is being handled by teachers and/or  administration at our school.&nbsp; </em></li>
		<li><em>We also keep awareness visible through posters  students have made, showing the videos our iStand group makes on the morning  school news, on stage skits during early release assemblies and varies  activities we may come up with that involve the whole student body.&nbsp; </em></li>
		<li><em>Our guidance counselor, Mr. Scholl, has also  started referencing our iStand group when talking to students about bullying  and character counts, explaining to the classes what being an &ldquo;iStander, not a  bystander&rdquo; represents.&nbsp; </em></li>
	</ul>
	<p>Shawna also has plans for the future, which include<em>: </em></p>
	<ul>
		<li><em>Share the&nbsp; iStand program with other  schools.&nbsp; We have found that awareness through our students is the best  way to get the message out there.&nbsp; Using the iStand group as tools through  skits, videos and modeling behavior keeps the budget low and the interest from  their peers high.&nbsp; We use online resources, such as the PACER site which  has a lot of valuable tools, as well as others you can find on the  internet.&nbsp; Using &ldquo;iStand &ldquo; in elementary schools across the board would  not only increase awareness at an early age, but also give school groups a  chance to share ideas of what activities are working to bring and keep the  awareness alive among the students and staff.&nbsp; </em></li>
		<li><em>Create a branch of &ldquo;iStand&rdquo; to incorporate it  in the middle schools, using the campaign name, &ldquo;Demonstrate Don&rsquo;t Intimidate&rdquo;  slogan.&nbsp; In the elementary schools we use &ldquo;Be an iStander, not a  bystander&rdquo;.&nbsp; While we can still use that in the middle schools, we also  want to focus on those students with strong personalities to be an example and  use that strength to demonstrate positive role modeling among their  peers.&nbsp; At the elementary level, even though they happen, we try to keep  all of the grim consequences of bullying out of the meetings and  activities.&nbsp; At the middle school level we will go a little more into the  desperate measures that students may take to escape the pain of and avoid  bullying, both at school and&nbsp; through technology (internet, cell phone,  etc.), in order to target the specifics of bullying at their age level.&nbsp; </em></li>
	</ul>
	<p>Shawna has offered to share several  of the resources from the toolkit that she and Lana developed, these free  resources include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li class="pdficonlist"><a href="/bullying/stories/school-action/events/pdf/iStandToolkit.pdf" target="_blank">&ldquo;iStand&rdquo; toolkit</a></li>
		<li class="pdficonlist"><a href="/bullying/stories/school-action/events/pdf/iStandActivities.pdf" target="_blank">Activity ideas to use in your school</a></li>
		<li><a href="mailto:hixons@martin.k12.fl.us">Sign up  for &ldquo;sharing&rdquo; group list</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;"><em>&ldquo;We  can do so much with so little if it&rsquo;s presented in the right ways.&nbsp; Just  knowing someone is watching, listening and willing to stand up could mean the  world to that one person who dreads going to school every day.&rdquo; </em>Shawna  Hixon</p>
