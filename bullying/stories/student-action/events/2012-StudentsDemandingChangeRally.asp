                        <p>The voice of Minnesota students was  heard Feb. 11, 2012 at the State Capitol in St. Paul as more than 100 teens wearing  orange rallied to support stronger bullying prevention legislation. Organized  by <strong>Students Demanding Change</strong>, with  the support of <strong>PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying  Prevention Center</strong>, the rally generated substantial media coverage. There  were multiple television news reports on the Minneapolis-St. Paul affiliates of  ABC, CBS, and NBC, as well as stories on Minnesota Public Radio (MPR) and in  the Minneapolis &ldquo;Star-Tribune&rdquo; newspaper.<br /></p>
                        <p>Students Demanding Change believes  that student perspective is vital if the State Legislature is going to  successfully write a new law to prevent bullying, both in schools and in social  media. The current state law is just 37 words long and is one of the weakest in  America.<strong></strong><br /></p>
                        <p><strong>Actor</strong> <strong>Colin Ford</strong>, one of  the stars of the film &ldquo;We Bought a Zoo,&rdquo; appeared at the rally via Skype,  offering his support for the students&rsquo; bullying prevention efforts. <strong>State Representative Jim Davnie</strong> (DFL-  Minneapolis) addressed the crowd in the Capitol rotunda. <strong>Julie Hertzog</strong>, director of PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention  Center, and her son David shared their personal story. And organizer <strong>Audrey Berdahl-Baldwin</strong> led the  participants in a raucous chant to close the rally.<br /></p>
                        <p>In an interview with MPR, organizer <strong>Sydney Eberwein</strong> said students would  feel better if they knew state law required teachers and school administrators  to take action when bullying occurs. &ldquo;That provides a little more hope for  students, which is what we want to accomplish,&rdquo; said Eberwein, one of four  Mounds Park Academy students who led the rally. &ldquo;We want to provide students  with hope that it will get better.&rdquo;<br /></p>
