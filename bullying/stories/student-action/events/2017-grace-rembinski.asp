    <p><em>&ldquo;I want you to know that you are not invisible, you are not forgettable; you are wonderful.&rdquo; </em></p>
    <p>This is one of many kind lyrics in Grace Rembinski&rsquo;s new song titled, &ldquo;I Want You to Know.&rdquo; She co-wrote this song, recorded in both English and Spanish, for &ldquo;friends and for anyone who has ever been told that they are not good enough. To show them that no matter how awful people make you feel, how hopeless life may seem, things do get better; and many others have been in your shoes. If you believe in yourself, that's all you need and with that, anything is possible.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Grace first experienced bullying when she was in 6th grade by a group of people she considered her friends. It began when she started singing and performing in the local community theatre. Soon after, she found out they were finding any reason to make fun of her. &ldquo;My &quot;friends&rsquo; would walk by me in the school halls or in our neighborhood like I wasn't there. I was being made fun of for my &lsquo;big crooked teeth,&rsquo; for being a &lsquo;nerd,&rsquo; for dressing differently than everyone else, and for the way my hair looked. They said I was &lsquo;different,&rsquo; and I was feeling left out of everything,&rdquo; said Grace.</p>
    <p>One day Grace decided she didn&rsquo;t deserve to be treated that way. &ldquo;I was done going through the things I had gone through. I stopped trying to make excuses for the way I was, and made new friends that loved me for me. I also just didn&rsquo;t care what people thought anymore. This was probably the hardest thing for me to do. To embrace the things that made me &lsquo;different&rsquo; and to just be myself.&rdquo; </p>
    <p>After connecting with a music producer in Nashville, Grace realized that through music, she could show others that they deserve to be treated with kindness. Due to the affects bullying had on her, Grace really wanted to build a song about self-love, and she did just that with &ldquo;I Want You to Know.&rdquo; Â </p>
    <p>&ldquo;Now, I have a wonderful group of friends, who unfortunately have also experienced bullying. My hope is that people, adults and kids, can listen to this song and feel inspired to be themselves.&rdquo;</p>
