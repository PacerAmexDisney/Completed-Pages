                        <p>Cassidy Stoltenberg is the 2016 Miss Randolph County Outstanding Teen and has reached out to schools and community groups in North Carolina to educate students about bullying prevention. She has done some amazing things in the community!</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Created videos discussing bullying</li>
                            <li>Provided public service announcements for the local radio stations to promote bullying prevention</li>
                            <li>Made hundreds of orange ribbons to be distributed in the schools</li>
                            <li>Provided written literature and presented PACER’s Teens Against Bullying message to middle and high school students</li>
                            <li>Initiated petitions to bring an end to bullying.  Cassidy has almost 1000 signatures from students who have taken the pledge recognizing that &quot;The end of bullying begins with me&quot;</li>
                            <li>Started open discussions during Young Life club meetings to encourage others to join in bringing more awareness to issues of bullying within the community</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Cassidy is also planning to request a governor’s proclamation naming October as North Carolina's National Bullying Prevention Month. She will be competing in Miss North Carolina's Outstanding Teen Pageant this summer with a goal to be crowned, and use her platform to further the discussion across North Carolina about bullying prevention. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Miss-Randolph-Countys-Outstanding-Teen-462534163936206/" target="_blank">Learn more about Cassidy's efforts</a>.</p>
