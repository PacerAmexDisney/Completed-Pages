    <p>Family, Career and Community Leaders of America (FCCLA) is a  national student organization that helps young men and women become leaders and address important personal, family, work and societal issues through family and consumer sciences education. High schools across the nation affiliate members into their chapters to develop service projects and other programs to promote positive values.</p>
      <p>Members of the FCCLA chapter of Winnsboro, Texas, involve themselves in a variety of projects year after year to promote good ideas and  leadership skills. This year, Kailey Hensley and Courtney Myre have developed a bullying prevention campaign to spread the word about the effects bullying can have, and what anyone can do to prevent it.</p>
      <p>Kailey and Courtney told PACER that &#8220;they’re not just talking the talk though! They have developed a project that gets their classmates and entire community involved in putting an end to bullying!&#8221;</p>
      <p>They began by hosting a coloring contest at their elementary school campus to educate the younger classes about cyberbullying, and how it’s important to seek help if needed and give help when needed. Every student who participated received a PACER Kids Against Bullying Bookmark complete with the pledge to stop bullying for them to sign, declaring them proponents of a bully-free future!</p>
      <p>Also, Kailey and Courtney decided, what better way to spread the message about cyberbullying than from the source? Members were asked to take part in a YouTube video, highlighting challenges students face online, but reminding them that they can be overcome. Finally, the FCCLA chapter furnished wristbands embellished with the words “Me vs. Bullying” to indicate the person wearing it is against bullying. All of the proceeds will be donated to the PACER’s National Bullying Prevention Center.</p>
      <p>Winnsboro FCCLA wants to spread this message  so students everywhere can remember that bullying is wrong, and cyberbullying is NEVER okay. Make preventing bullying a trend: #NoHate</p>
