            <p>Sara Stevens is a 15 year old singer who enjoys every bit of life! She has also experienced being bullied. She was bullied for being too tall, for drawing too much, for singing in class. Sara says, “I can’t help it. I have music inside me and I need to let it out.” Sara decided that she wanted to make singing her life-long career and reach out to those who have experienced bullying. Sara’s song, DANCE IN THIS DREAM, which was inspired by what she had gone through, has a powerful message about “looking for the positive and overcoming the negative. The most important thing a person can do is to be him or herself. Don’t let anything hold you back, take your chance, find your dream and everything is possible!” She hopes this song will touch many lives. </p>

            <h3 align="center">DANCE IN THIS DREAM</h3>
            <p align="center">There are dark days we wish to forget<br />
              There are times we feel sadness and pain<br />
              Twisted words we might someday regret<br />
              Bitter memories left out in the rain<br />
              But I've learned lessons of love come with tears<br />
              Time takes away sorrow and fear<br />
              My heart will grow stronger<br />
              Surrounded by light<br />
              Surrounded by love<br />
              I'm not afraid to dance in this dream<br />
              I can't believe what's happened to me<br />
              I'll find my way through all I believe<br />
              Unbroken when I dance in this dream<br />
              Many burdens we carry inside<br />
              Tender wounds from the struggles we bare<br />
              Endless searching for somewhere to hide<br />
              Restless longing for dreams we can share<br />
              But I've seen visions of hope in these eyes<br />
              Life teaches the truth from these lies<br />
              My heart will grow stronger<br />
              Surrounded by light<br />
              Surrounded by love<br />
              I'm not afraid to dance in this dream<br />
              I can't believe what's happened to me<br />
              I'll find my way through all believe<br />
              Unbroken when I dance in this dream<br />
              Here I stand with my arms opened wide<br />
              Do you believe in me<br />
              Heaven knows what tomorrow may find<br />
              I'm gonna spread these wings I'm gonna learn how to fly<br />
              Not afraid to dance in this dream<br />
              I can't believe what's happened to me<br />
              I'll find my way through all I believe<br />
              Unbroken<br />
              When I dance in this dream<br />
              Not afraid to dance in this dream<br />
              I can't believe what's happened to me<br />
              I'll find my way through all I believe<br />
              Unbroken<br />
              When I dance in this dream</p>
