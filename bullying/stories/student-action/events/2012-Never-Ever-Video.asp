            <h1 id="maincontent">Students at Sycamore Junior High in Ohio Stand Against Bullying in Making the NEVER EVER Music Video</h1>
            <div id="leftcontent">
                <p>As music video director Dawn Bierschwal listened to Keenan West&rsquo;s &ldquo;Never Ever,&rdquo; she realized it was a song that could provide inspiration for the kids standing on the sidelines of bullying to &ldquo;Never Ever&rdquo;
                    leave those being bullied alone. Having the courage to stand up for the kids being bullied is something Bierschwal tries to teach her two teens who have experienced the horror of a bully-related teen suicide in their own school
                    district. That death was the result of a text message, one of the scenarios portrayed in the video.  Most of the kids in the video are from the Sycamore Junior High in Montgomery, Ohio – a school committed to ending bullying and
                    in that same school district. </p>
                <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re trying to teach kids that teasing, exclusion, and intolerance don&rsquo;t have to be rites of passage through adolescence,&rdquo; says Principal Karen Naber. &ldquo;When we empower kids to embrace differences and
                    stand up for one another, we believe they will choose respect and kindness as their rites of passage instead.&rdquo; West kicked off production of the video with a concert for the Ohio school held in conjunction with one of its
                    bullying prevention assemblies. The school used the whole video production process as a way to reinforce the lessons school leaders are trying to teach.</p>
                <p>The video was cast with more than 40 kids from the school&rsquo;s drama club who were in the process of rehearsing a musical called &ldquo;13,&rdquo; a show about coming of age with similar themes. Theater Director Kylie Parks
                    loved the idea of these kids making the video at the same time they were rehearsing for the musical. She felt it would help them better relate to their characters&rsquo; experiences. When Bierschwal asked the &ldquo;13&rdquo; cast
                    if they, or someone they knew, had ever been bullied, every hand in the room went up. As a result, the students didn&rsquo;t just act and sing background vocals, they contributed to many of the scenarios shown in the video drawing
                    from their own experiences. </p>
                <p>&ldquo;It was so rewarding to see how the kids related and responded to the song&rsquo;s message,&rdquo; says West. &ldquo;It was an incredible experience to have so many of them thank us for making this video and proactively tell
                    us that, as a result of being involved, they are more aware of the bullying around them and will no longer stand on the sidelines.&rdquo; Some of the students have even expressed interest in taking a leadership role in bullying
                    prevention efforts as they transition to the high school next year.</p>
                <p>As someone who was bullied herself, Bierschwal understands the pain it can cause – the chalk scene in the video came from her own experience – but more importantly, she understands the difference it can make when another child
                    takes the risk, and has the courage, to be there for someone who is bullied. &ldquo;When you feel like you are &lsquo;Never Ever&rsquo; alone it can make the difference between wanting to take your own life and being able to move
                    on from the experience,&rdquo; says Bierschwal. &ldquo;I hope my own children never have to experience what I did. But if they do, I hope there will be kids who have the courage to be there for them.&rdquo; </p>
                <p>While West wasn&rsquo;t bullied as a kid, the more he learned about the nationwide bullying issue, the more he was committed to doing something about it. &ldquo;I was one of the kids standing on the sidelines, and what I realize
                    now,&rdquo; says West &ldquo;is that I was just as wrong as the bullies themselves. We need to make it cool to stand up to bullying.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Bierschwal and West approached PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center about partnering with the organization because PACER&rsquo;s focus and message is similar to what they wanted to convey through their video. As they
                    talked to PACER about wanting to give kids the courage to stand up against bullying, they learned that PACER was developing its &quot;FIND THE COURAGE&quot; campaign. The goal of the campaign is to creatively provide students with
                    the education and empowerment to take action. PACER has now made the video a key part of the campaign and West is donating 50 cents from every digital download of &quot;Never Ever&quot; to support PACER&rsquo;s work.<br/></p>
