<p>To help teens unite against bullying, CustomInk is launching its 4th annual <a href="http://www.customink.com/stopbullying" target="_blank">Be Good to Each Other bullying prevention campaign</a>.  Coinciding with the back-to-school season and October&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention month, the campaign encourages students, groups and others to take a stand for kindness and tolerance by designing and wearing custom bullying prevention t-shirts.  All profits from the sale of bullying prevention t-shirts will benefit CustomInk&rsquo;s non-profit partner &ndash; <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying" target="_blank">PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center</a>, which unites, engages and educates communities nationwide to address bullying through its resources.</p>

  <h3>How to Get Involved</h3>
  <p>Now through October 31, check out <a href="http://www.customink.com/stopbullying" target="_blank">www.customink.com/stopbullying</a> to get involved. Everyone is invited to celebrate PACER&rsquo;s UNITY DAY on Wednesday, October 22, when the organization encourages people to send a message of support to students who have experienced bullying by wearing orange. PACER&rsquo;s exclusive 2014 UNITY DAY shirts are available for purchase for $12 (with at least $9 per shirt donated to PACER).  All UNITY DAY t-shirt orders placed by October 9th are guaranteed to arrive in time for UNITY DAY.</p>

  <p>Additionally, students, community groups, and others can design and personalize bullying prevention t-shirts for their school, team or organization. Fans can also buy their favorite celebrity&rsquo;s custom designed shirt in support of the cause.</p>

  <h3>Celebrities Unite for Bullying Prevention</h3>
  <p>Several celebrities have joined forces with CustomInk and PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center to support the cause.  This year&rsquo;s celebrities include: Lauren Potter (Glee), Peyton Meyer (Girl Meets World), Kira Kosarin (The Thundermans), Katie Leclerc (Switched at Birth), Charlie Villanueva (professional basketball player), Ryan McCartan (Liv &amp; Maddie), Rachel McCord (celebrity blogger), Sherri Saum (The Fosters), AnnaSophia Robb (The Carrie Diaries), Paul Rabil (professional lacrosse player and member of U.S. Men&rsquo;s National Team), Kyle Kleiboeker (Broadway performer and former contestant on Summer Camp), Christen Press (professional soccer player and striker for U.S. Women&rsquo;s National Team).</p>

  <p>Each celebrity has designed their own custom bullying prevention t-shirt that will be available for purchase for $20, with 100% of the profits benefiting PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center (with at least $9 per shirt donated to PACER).  Celebrities will also utilize the power of social media to engage and connect with their fans to spread a message of kindness and understanding.</p>

  <p>Everyone is encouraged to get involved on social media and show their support by using the hashtags #BG2EO and #UNITYDAY2014.</p></td>
