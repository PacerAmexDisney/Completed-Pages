    <p>Paula F. Goldberg is the Executive Director and founder of <a href="http://www.pacer.org" target="_blank">PACER Center</a>, a nonprofit organization with more than 30 years of experience serving children with disabilities and their families. PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center is one of 32 initiatives managed by PACER Center.</p>
  <p>Since PACER opened its first office in 1978, with five staff members, it has worked to improve and expand opportunities that enhance the quality of life for children and young adults with disabilities and their families.  Through Goldberg&rsquo;s leadership and leading the creation of several innovative programs, PACER now has over 70 staff and continues to impact families across the nation and even internationally.</p>
  <p>In 1984, Goldberg was instrumental in helping to develop the national parent center technical assistance program which supports the network of 100+ Parent Centers throughout the United States. Parent centers work with families and professionals to improve outcomes for children with disabilities in the school, home and community. PACER has served as a regional or a national technical assistance parent  center for 30 years and Goldberg led the development of a system to collect evaluation and outcome data for the parent centers.</p>
  <p>Goldberg, who has long been recognized for her leadership in the parent center movement, is also recognized as a leader on bullying prevention. As she did with PACER and the parent centers, Goldberg played a leadership role in creating PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center in 2006. She not only helped to conceptualize National Bullying Prevention Month, which has evolved into a nationally known education campaign, she is also instrumental in working on national and global levels to prevent bullying. In 2011, Goldberg was invited to the White House Conference on Bullying Prevention and testified about bullying of children with disabilities before the U.S. Civil Rights Commission. In 2012, Goldberg accepted a national award from the FBI. The FBI Director&rsquo;s Community Leadership Award honored PACER&rsquo;s national bullying prevention efforts.</p>

  <p><strong>PACER Center Co-Founder Paula Goldberg Talks Bullying Prevention</strong><br />
  <em>by: Laura Clark of Mom.me</em></p>
    <p>When Paula Goldberg was a young mother of two in Minneapolis, she was confronted with a life-defining choice &mdash; go to law school, where she had been accepted, or lead a nonprofit organization with a mission close to her heart. The former teacher decided on the latter. That was 1977 and Goldberg is still the executive director of the PACER Center, an organization dedicated to helping kids with disabilities and their parents. But her work didn't stop there. <a href="/bullying/about/media-kit/images/mom-me-article.pdf" target="_blank">Read entire article&gt;&gt;&gt;</a></p>

   <p>Julie Hertzog, Director of PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention  Center, is a nationally recognized leader on bullying prevention. Since she helped create the Center in 2006, she has led in the development of its resources, including creating content for its innovative websites&mdash; <a href="http://www.pacerkidsagainstbullying.org/" target="_blank">PACERKidsAgainstBullying.org</a> and <a href="http://www.pacerteensagainstbullying.org/#/home" target="_blank">PACERTeensAgainstBullying.org</a>&mdash;which were designed to engage, educate, and inspire students. In addition to developing classroom toolkits, curricula, and other innovative resources, such as the <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/resources/students-with-disabilities/peer-advocacy.asp">peer advocacy project</a> and &ldquo;<a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/wewillgen/">The WE WILL Generation</a>,&rdquo; Hertzog also helped create initiatives such as <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/nbpm/">PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Month</a>, <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/nbpm/unity-day.asp">Unity Day</a>, and <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/nbpm/runwalkroll/events-around-the-country.asp">Run, Walk, Roll Against Bullying</a>, which are now nationally recognized events each October.</p>
  <p>In 2012, she was appointed as a member and co-chair of Minnesota&rsquo;s Governor&rsquo;s Task Force on the Prevention of School Bullying.</p>
  <p>In 2013, Julie was an external reviewer for <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/bullying-definitions-final-a.pdf" target="_blank">BULLYING SURVEILLANCE AMONG YOUTHS: UNIFORM DEFINITIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND RECOMMENDED DATA ELEMENTS</a> developed by National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the United States Department of Education. That year, Julie was also featured speaker in a campaign created by the Ad Council titled <a href="http://www.stopbullying.gov/respond/be-more-than-a-bystander/index.html" target="_blank">&ldquo;Be More Than A Bystander&rdquo;</a> which is posted to the Stop Bullying.gov website.</p>
  <p> In 2014, she was appointed to Minnesota&rsquo;s School Safety Technical Assistance Center, which was created in response to the Minnesota Safe and Supportive School legislation.</p>
  <p>Hertzog has been quoted and consulted by the local and national media, including print, online and TV, and has been featured on CNN, NBC Nightly News with Brian Williams, Time for Kids, PEOPLE, Family Circle and The Huffington Post.</p>
  <p>Julie holds a Master&rsquo;s Degree in Counseling Psychology and has been on staff at PACER Center since 2000.  She is married with three children: Laura, David and Grace. David, who was born with Down syndrome, has been the inspiration for much of Julie&rsquo;s work as students with disabilities are 2-3 times more likely than their peers to be bullied.</p>
