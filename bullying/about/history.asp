The staff at PACER Center noted that parents of children with disabilities were calling more frequently about bullying situations, and the stories were heartbreaking. As parents continued to express their concerns that they did not know how to help their child and did not know what their rights were or what steps to take, PACER decided to take action.

				History and Impact</h1>
			<h3 style="text-align:center">Early 2000: Creating a culture to prevent bullying</h3>	
			<p>The staff at <a href="http://www.pacer.org/about/" target="_blank">PACER Center</a> noted that parents of children with disabilities were calling more frequently about bullying situations, and the stories were heartbreaking. As parents continued to express their concerns that they did not know how to help their child and did not know what their rights were or what steps to take, PACER decided to take action.<br />
				<br />
				With a focus on building a culture in which bullying was no longer tolerated as an accepted rite of passage, PACER began developing free, easy-to-access resources for parents, students, schools and communities.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>In 2003, PACER launched the curriculum &ldquo;Is Your Child a Target of Bullying? Intervention Strategies for Parents of Children with Disabilities,&rdquo; which was distributed nationally.</li>
				<li>During 2004, PACER continued to develop printed information about bullying prevention for children with disabilities.</li>
				<li>In 2005, PACER received their first grant to develop bullying prevention resources. At that time, it was decided that it was important that the resources be designed for all children, including those with disabilities. In response, PACER developed PACERKidsAgainstBullying.org, which is a website with a cast of 12 animated characters.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 style="text-align:center; padding-top:20px">2006: Launched the National Bullying Prevention Center</h3>
			<p>During 2006, PACER formed the National Bullying Prevention Center. The organization also launched PACERKidsAgainstBullying.org, an interactive website for elementary age students, and created <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Bullying_Prevention_Month" target="_blank">National Bullying Prevention Week</a>, which grew into a month-long event in October 2010, and is now celebrated throughout the United States and internationally.</p>
			<p>The demand for resources continued to grow, and PACER responded to that need by developing more resources, offering free information, and creating awareness campaigns.</p>
			<p>Today, PACER continues to offer free and creative online resources to students, schools, parents, and the community through three websites:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://www.PACER.org/Bullying"> PACER.org/Bullying</a> &ndash; Provides free resources to schools and communities</li>
				<li><a href="http://www.PACERTeensAgainstBullying.org"> PACERTeensAgainstBullying.org</a> &ndash; Educates middle and high school students</li>
				<li><a href="http://www.PACERKidsAgainstBullying.org"> PACERKidsAgainstBullying.org</a> &ndash; Educates elementary school students</li>
