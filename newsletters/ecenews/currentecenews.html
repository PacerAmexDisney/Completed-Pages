  <h3 class="blue">HELPING CHILDREN ENJOY THEIR TIME IN THE CAR</h3>
  <p>As summer approaches and young children are out of school, parents may find themselves planning a family car trip or simply trying to make running errands a bit easier. But with all that time spent in the car, there is a way to make it more enjoyable for children.</p>
  <p>Consider having a bin or basket of some your child&rsquo;s favorite toys or activities. Items in the bin may include favorite books, a stuffed animal, washable markers and paper, or sticker books. You could include some stories or photos about the errands you are running or the place to which you are traveling.</p>
  <p>You may also want to include some snacks or spill-proof drinks to take along, and change the items in the bin often enough to keep your child&rsquo;s interest. </p>
  
  <h3 class="red">NEW INCLUSION VIDEO RELEASED</h3>
  <p>The California-based Desired Results Access Project has released a new video titled &ldquo;Getty&rsquo;s Door to Inclusion,&rdquo; which depicts a young girl named Getty who cannot physically be near other children because of health issues. The video shows Getty virtually attending a typical kindergarten classroom.</p>
  <p>It illustrates the importance of having consistent and high expectations for all children, sound communication strategies and effective parent-teacher collaboration.</p>
  <p>It also provides important messages for all those interested in early childhood and elementary school inclusion, for all current and future early childhood educators, and for families who are looking for solutions for their children who cannot attend school due to health issues.</p>
  <p>The video is available from the <a href="http://draccess.org/videolibrary/">Desired Results Access Project Video Library</a> (click on the General Interest tab). &nbsp;</p>
  
  <h3 class="orange">PACER OFFERS EARLY CHILDHOOD WEBINARS</h3>
  <p>Archived webinars are a way to gain information about topics of interest to parents of young children with disabilities. Look for PACER webinars listed as &ldquo;Early Childhood&rdquo; <a href="http://www.pacer.org/webinars/archive-listing.asp">here</a>. </p>
  
  <h3 class="green">HELP ME GROW</h3>
  <p>Some young children need extra help to learn and grow. &ldquo;Help Me Grow,&rdquo; an interagency initiative of the State of Minnesota, provides resources for families to look at developmental milestones, learn if there are concerns, and take the lead in seeking additional support or in referring their child for a comprehensive, confidential screening or evaluation.</p>
  <p>Eligible Minnesota children, from birth to age 5, can receive services in their home, a child care setting, or at school, and services are free regardless of income or immigration status.
