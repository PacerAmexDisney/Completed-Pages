			<p><strong>Your help is needed <u>today</u>: Bill  removing most MN Special Education laws is introduced!</strong><br />
			  Senator John  Pederson (SD 15—St Cloud and surrounding communities) has introduced <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/revisor/pages/search_status/status_detail.php?b=Senate&amp;f=SF1291&amp;ssn=0&amp;y=2011">SF  1291</a>. <u>This bill repeals, or eliminates most of the sections of Minnesota  law that tell schools and districts how to serve students with disabilities.</u>  In addition to the 54 sections of  Minnesota law eliminated, the bill also removes 28 parts of special education  rules that give further guidance to schools and districts. It would repeal most Minnesota special education law  and rule, which provide needed protections and exceed Federal Individuals with  Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) law. <strong>This  bill, if enacted, would cause delays in service for children with disabilities,  increase misunderstanding and complaints about special education services, and  strip 50 years of protections from Minnesota’s  special education system. </strong></p>
            <p><strong><u>Please contact these legislators today!  This is a statewide action alert for all in Minnesota</u></strong></p>
            <ol>

            <p>Important protections for students with disabilities are eliminated in  this bill, including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Specific procedures and protections  governing suspension and expulsion for students with disabilities, also known  as the Minnesota Pupil Fair Dismissal Act (121A.43) and  associated rules (Minn. R. 3525.2325)</li>
              <li>Specialized training for  paraprofessionals who will work with students with disabilities (125A.08(c))</li>
              <li>Parents’ advice on special  education programming through Advisory Councils (125A.24)</li>
              <li>Instruction in Braille for  students who are blind and visually impaired that would allow them to  communicate at the same level expected of students without disabilities, also  known as the Blind Persons’ Literacy Rights and Education Act (125A.06)</li>
              <li>Specific responsibilities and procedures  for cooperation and payment between districts and other agencies, including  more than 50 years of legislative history protecting the rights of students  with disabilities in schools of parents’ choice (125A.13), foster care  (125A.17), and treatment and corrections facilities (125A.52)</li>

              <p><strong>Background Information</strong>:</p>
            </div>
            <ul>
              <li>These eliminations would not  reduce any paperwork burden on schools and districts. In fact, removing this  guiding language leaves many decisions up to individual school districts. This  would be more work, to establish cooperative agreements and processes  individually. </li>
              <li>Minnesota has a historically  low level of complaint and due process filings. Removing the language that establishes  common understanding of complicated services and cooperative relationships  creates uncertainty in the system. This uncertainty will likely lead to an  increase in complaints and due process.</li>
              <li>Much  work has been done already to identify Minnesota laws that exceed Federal  Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) guidelines. Two Special Education Legislative  Task Forces, in 2007-2008 and 2008-2009, included advocates and educators. The task forces decided that many Minnesota laws were important to keep for children with disabilities and came to consensus decisions to repeal many special education laws.&nbsp;  The 2009 Legislature enacted these consensus decisions and received the Task  Forces’ reports.</li>
