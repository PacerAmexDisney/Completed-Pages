    <h3>October is PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Month</h3>
      <p><strong><em>The End of Bullying Begins with Me </em></strong>is the message to remember during PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Month in October. It&rsquo;s a time when communities unite nationwide to raise awareness of bullying prevention through events, activities, outreach, and education. PACER <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Bullying_Prevention_Month">created the campaign in 2006</a> with a one-week event which has now evolved into a month-long effort to encourage everyone to take an active role in the bullying prevention movement. PACER offers a variety of resources to use year-round, but especially during October, to inspire, educate, and inform. Check out the many events and activities, and make plans to <strong>join the movement and take action where you live!</strong> <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/nbpm/"><strong>Find out more</strong></a></p>
