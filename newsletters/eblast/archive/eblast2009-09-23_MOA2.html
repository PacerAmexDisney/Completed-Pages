					<h1>Take action against bullying by attending PACER&rsquo;s Oct.  6 event at Mall of America</h1>
				
				<p><em>U.S. Assistant Secretary for Safe and Drug-Free Schools </em><em>to speak </em></p>
				<p>Teens, kids, parents, and  educators are invited to show support for the movement against bullying at a PACER Center  event on Tuesday, Oct. 6, from 4:15 to 5 p.m. at the Mall of America&rsquo;s Best Buy  Rotunda, located on Level I, East between  Sears and Bloomingdales. </p>
				<p>Kevin Jennings, U.S. Assistant Deputy Secretary for Safe and  Drug-Free Schools,  will speak at the event highlighting PACER   Center&rsquo;s National  Bullying Prevention Week, Oct. 4-10. This is  Jenning&rsquo;s first speaking engagement in Minnesota  since his recent appointment to this high level position in the U.S. Department  of Education.</p>
				<p>Sponsored by PACER Center&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention  Center, the event also includes the debut of Disney star Demi Lovato&rsquo;s public  service announcement for PACER&rsquo;s new <a href="http://www.pacerteensagainstbullying.org/">TeensAgainstBullying.org</a> Web site, as well  as great give aways and drawings, live music, contests, and the chance to sign  a petition supporting the movement to stop bullying. &ldquo;Working together, we can  make a difference,&rdquo; says Lovato, who was bullied in seventh grade. &ldquo;No one  deserves to be bullied.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Up to one-third of the nation&rsquo;s students are bullied during  the academic year, and more than 60 percent witness bullying daily. The results  of bullying can be devastatingâ€”or even tragic. </p>
				<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re  inviting everyone to join us at the Mall of America for this event, and to join  us in this movement to end bullying,&rdquo; said Paula Goldberg, PACER&rsquo;s executive  director. &ldquo;By signing the petition, you can influence change and help us work  for greater protection of students.&rdquo;</p>
				The  event also includes:
				<ul type="disc">
					<li><strong>Live music by Lindsay Rush</strong>, who will perform her new single, &ldquo;Odd Girl Out,&rdquo; co-written by &ldquo;The Gyrlz&rdquo; (Daughtry and Hillary Duff). The song is about being bullied. MacPhail Center for Music students will perform before the event.</li>
					<li><strong>Give aways:</strong> The first 300 teenagers to sign the online petition at the event will receive a <span class="special">Best Buy $10 gift card</span>. Computers will be available for petition signing. Other give aways include <span class="special">free bookmarks, T-shirts, and more</span>.</li>
					<li><strong>A chance to support Teens Against Bullying.</strong> Teens age 14-18 can sign up on Best Buy&rsquo;s @15 Web site (at15.com) and earn &ldquo;points&rdquo; to share with Teens Against Bullying, which can earn up to $250,000 for PACER&rsquo;s Bullying Prevention Center and <a href="http://www.teensagainstbullying.org/">TeensAgainstBullying.org</a>.</li>
					<li><strong>Drawings</strong>: Teens (14-18) who sign up on at15.com during the event may place their name in a drawing for an <span class="special">iPod touch</span>. Any school or organization with <em>5 or more</em> students attending can enter the school/organization in a drawing to receive one of ten <span class="special">$100 Best Buy gift cards</span>.</li>
					<li><strong>Contests:</strong> Elementary school students can provide artwork to be posted to PACER&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.kidsagainstbullying.org/">KidsAgainstBullying.org</a> Web site.</li>
					<li><strong>An appearance by the Kids Against Bullying puppets</strong>. </li>
