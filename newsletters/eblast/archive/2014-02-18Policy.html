		<h2>PACER Legislative Alert -  Supporting Youth With Disabilities<strong> </strong></h2>
<p>The  U.S. Congress is considering changes to the Workforce Investment Act and the  federal Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) Program that assists youth and adults  with disabilities to get the education and training they need to obtain and  retain a job. While Congress is trying to strengthen the VR services that  students with disabilities would receive as they transition out of high school,  we are concerned that some possible changes would hurt families of youth with  disabilities. PACER is asking families and others to call their representatives  about the following points critical to families and youth:</p>
		<ol>
		<li>
		<p><strong>Oppose moving the Vocational Rehabilitation and  Assistive Technology programs out of the Department of Education.</strong> The  Senate version of this legislation seeks to move VR to the Department of Labor  and the Assistive Technology program to the Department of Health and Human  Services. Moving these programs out of the Department of Education will  disconnect them from a culture valuing parental involvement and the other  programs that support students with disabilities.&nbsp; We are concerned such a  move will only damage strong family connections and important services provided  to youth and adults with disabilities here in Minnesota.<br />
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>Strengthen competitive employment awareness  provisions. </strong>Ensuring that young adults with disabilities transitioning from  high school to employment are aware that jobs which pay the minimum wage and  higher are available is an important aspect of providing individuals the  opportunity to reach their potential. The bill could be strengthened by  ensuring that there are no exceptions to making sure young adults are made  aware of their opportunity to work in a competitive workplace setting before  selecting a non-competitive, often less than minimum wage, work experience.</p>
		
		</li>
		</ol>
<p> Please  contact your U.S. Representative today about these important issues. Find their  phone number here: <a href="http://house.gov/representatives/find/">http://house.gov/representatives/find/</a>.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>Sincerely,</p>
