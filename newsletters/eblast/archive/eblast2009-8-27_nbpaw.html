			<p>As part of PACER Center&rsquo;s <strong>fourth annual <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/bpaw/index.asp">National Bullying Prevention Awareness Week</a>, Oct. 4 &ndash; 10,  2009,  </strong>children, teens, adults, schools, and communities across the  country are encouraged to partner with PACER to prevent bullying. The movement  is being given a boost with the launch of <a href="http://www.pacerteensagainstbullying.org/">PACERTeensAgainstBullying.org</a>&mdash;a  relevant, edgy Web site created by and for teens. In addition to videos, stories,  blogs, and social networking, the site features a toolbox of things teens and  schools can do to address bullying&mdash;from creating their own videos to performing  role plays for younger students. </p>
			<p>Every  day, more than160,000 children nationwide stay home from school to avoid  bullying. Up to one-third of the nation&rsquo;s students are bullied during the  academic year, and more than 60 percent witness bullying daily. The results of  bullying can be devastating&mdash;or even tragic. </p>
			<p>&ldquo;Our mission is to engage,  educate, and empower teens to care about bullying,&rdquo; said Paula Goldberg,  PACER&rsquo;s executive director. &ldquo;We encourage people nationwide to work together  during <strong>National  Bullying Prevention Awareness Week</strong> to increase awareness of the  prevalence and impact of bullying on all children.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>In addition to visiting <a href="http://www.pacerteensagainstbullying.org/">PACERTeensAgainstBullying.org</a> for teens and <a href="http://www.pacerkidsagainstbullying.org/">PACERKidsAgainstBullying.org</a> for elementary school children, people can help prevent bullying in several  ways. <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/bpaw/index.asp">Free activities</a> to help reduce bullying in schools, recreational programs, and community groups,  and materials such as contests, classroom toolkits, and more are available at  PACER.org. Organizations and schools can <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/bpaw/partners.asp">partner</a> with PACER  by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:bullying411@PACER.org">bullying411@PACER.org</a> with the name of  their school or organization, their Web site URL, and a note about what their  school is doing to support bullying prevention. <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/bpaw/partners.asp">Partners</a> are listed  on PACER&rsquo;s bullying prevention Web sites.<br />
  			<br />
  			&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  time to take action,&rdquo; Goldberg said. &ldquo;Teachers, parents, students, and adults  throughout each community must work together to create a climate that doesn&rsquo;t  accept bullying. When bullying is addressed, communities will see more students  with higher self-esteem, better school attendance, less physical and mental  stress, and better school performance.&rdquo;<br />
  <br />
  			<p>The week is sponsored by <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/index.asp">PACER&rsquo;s  National Bullying Prevention Center</a>, which <em>is for all children, including those with  disabilities. It promotes national bullying awareness and teaches effective  ways to respond to bullying. </em>National  Bullying Prevention Awareness Week is cosponsored by the American Federation  for Teachers, National Coalition for Parent Involvement in Education, National  Education Association, and School Social Work Association of America.</p>
			<p><a href="http://www.pacer.org/">PACER  Center</a> is a national parent center located in Minneapolis, Minn. <em>Serving all youth, with a special  emphasis on </em>children with disabilities,  it provides publications, workshops, individualized assistance, and other  resources to help families make decisions about education, vocational training,  employment, and other services for their children.
