	<h2>Season’s Greetings!</h2>
	<p><strong>Looking for a meaningful gift that will continue to give all year?</strong></p>
	<p>Grandparents, teachers, friends, neighbors—there are so many extraordinary people who make a difference in the lives of our children. This holiday season, show that special someone how important they are to your family by honoring them with a donation to PACER Center. For every donation made to PACER by Dec. 30, 2009, PACER will e-mail or mail a certificate recognizing the donation to the honoree to let them know how much they are appreciated. All donations will be used towards PACER’s programs to expand opportunities and enhance the quality of life for children and youth with disabilities. </p>
	<p>To donate in honor of someone special, <a href="https://pacer.ejoinme.org/MyPages/DonationPage/tabid/19833/Default.aspx">click here</a>. Be sure to fill in the honoree’s name and e-mail address so that we may send a certificate of recognition to them. </p>
	<p>Thank you so much for all you do to support PACER Center and children with disabilities throughout the year. With your help, we can continue to serve the increasing number of families who need assistance. You are truly appreciated!</p>
	<p>Sincerely,<br />
		Paula Goldberg <br />
		PACER Center<br />
