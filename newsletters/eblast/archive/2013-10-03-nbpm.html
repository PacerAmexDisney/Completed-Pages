      <p>Dear Friends,</p>
			<p>When PACER developed <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/nbpm/">National Bullying Prevention Month</a> in 2006, we could not have imagined that it would grow into such <strong>a significant national movement</strong> that is supported by dozens of organizations, and countless students, educators, and parents across the country. The goal, however, remains the same: To raise awareness for bullying prevention and to help keep children safe. There are so many ways that people can get involved during October and we wanted to be sure you were aware of the different activities and initiatives being led by <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying">PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center</a>.</p>
			<p><strong>Unity Day – Wednesday, Oct. 9</strong></p>
			<p>Students, teachers, and community members will wear orange and send a united message of support on <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/nbpm/unity-day.asp">Unity Day</a>,Wednesday, Oct. 9 (#UnityDay2013). Students will distribute orange &ldquo;UNITY&rdquo; ribbons, write the word &ldquo;UNITY&rdquo; on their hands or school binders, and post about Unity Day on social media. They will also be wearing the &ldquo;official&rdquo; <a href="http://www.customink.com/stopbullying">Unite Against Bullying T-shirt</a> thanks to a partnership with CustomInk, the design online T-shirt company. The partnership with CustomInk is part of its &ldquo;Be Good to Each Other&rdquo; campaign that encourages people to take a stand for kindness and tolerance. This is such a simple way to make a powerful statement, and proceeds support PACER&rsquo;s bullying prevention programs.</p>
			<p><strong>Web-based tools</strong></p>
			<p>Last year, two million people in nearly 200 countries used the National Bullying Prevention Center&rsquo;s resources and web-based tools to plan events, activities, outreach, and educational initiatives. Bullying prevention tools and resources are available on three websites: <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying">PACER.org/Bullying</a> for parents, teachers, and other adults; <a href="http://www.pacerteensagainstbullying.org">PACERTeensAgainstBullying.org</a> for teens; and <a href="http://www.pacerkidsagainstbullying.org">PACERKidsAgainstBullying.org</a> for elementary school students. One of the most popular tools is <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/resources/toolkits/classroom/school-event-guide.asp">&ldquo;Unite Against Bullying: A Student Event Planning Guide&rdquo;</a> which PACER created with the support of Facebook.</p>
			<p><strong>Run, Walk, Roll Against Bullying</strong></p>
			<p>Supporters  across the country are holding <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/nbpm/runwalkroll/events-around-the-country.asp">Run,  Walk, Roll Against Bullying</a> events in October to  raise awareness, including the <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/nbpm/runwalkroll/">Friends of PACER event</a> which was held this past weekend, in Bloomington, Minn.  PACER offers a free toolkit that makes it easy for organizations to stage a  Run, Walk, Roll Against Bullying in their community. Events are planned in more  than 20 cities this year, including Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and Las  Vegas. </p>
<p><strong>The We Will Generation</strong>&trade;</p>
			<p>This month, PACER launched the &ldquo;WE WILL Generation&trade;,&rdquo; a nationwide campaign and peer-to-peer curricula that will provide students with the tools they need to speak up on behalf of their peers, and prevent bullying in their schools, the community, and online. We recognize that students are in the best position to have the greatest influence with their peers and they want to make a difference. The WE WILL Generation&trade; provides students with the tools to do that. It is simple to implement and there is no cost to schools. The program is made possible in part by partnership with Green Giant, Disney, and other corporate supporters of PACER. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/wewillgen/">PACER.org/bullying/wewillgen</a></p>
			<p><strong>Raise a Giant</strong></p>
			<p>On Oct. 1, a new partnership – the <em>Raise a Giant</em> campaign – was announced between PACER and Green Giant to help parents and children find the courage to speak up and take action against bullying. The campaign pairs parents and children together to end bullying through various tools and activities, including a &ldquo;Giant&rdquo; surprise event to celebrate PACER&rsquo;s Unity Day on Oct. 9. The campaign is centered around an online open-letter writing campaign at <a href="http://www.raiseagiant.com/">raiseagiant.com</a>, where parents can use the power of story-telling to stand tall against the issue. Green Giant will also engage bloggers, influencers, and media to write and share letters and videos about bullying, aiming to stop bullying in their own communities. With the help of funding from Green Giant, PACER will introduce the WE WILL Generation&trade; to schools across the country this month.

			<p><strong>Choose Orange</strong></p>
			<p>When PACER created National Bullying Prevention Month in 2006, orange was adopted as the official color of bullying prevention. This year, students, families, educators, and businesses are being asked to &lsquo;Choose Orange&rsquo; as part of a national campaign to raise awareness for bullying prevention in a powerful, visual way. By wearing and sharing Choose Orange snap wrist bands, people are choosing to prevent bullying through kindness, compassion, and positivity. Proceeds from the campaign support the work of PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Center. You can find out more about the campaign at <a href="http://chooseorange.flipgive.com/campaigns/1838-buy-your-choose-orange-wrist-band-today/?ref=chooseorangecom">chooseorange.org</a>.</p>
			<p><strong>Become a Champion, Take the Pledge</strong></p>
			<p>Organizations and individuals can also take an active role during October by visiting <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/nbpm/">PACER.org/bullying/nbpm</a> and <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/nbpm/partners/champions.asp">choosing to be a Champion</a>, or by signing the digital petition pledging, &ldquo;The End of Bullying Begins with Me,&rdquo; at <a href="http://www.pacer.org/bullying/digitalpetition/">PACER.org/bullying/digitalpetition</a>. National partners include the National Education Association, the American Federation for Teachers, the National PTA, and many others.</p>
			<p>Thank you so much for all of your support during PACER&rsquo;s National Bullying Prevention Month and throughout the year. Your actions are helping to change the paradigm so that bullying will no longer be acceptable in our society.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			
			
			<p>Sincerely,</p>
			<p>Paula Goldberg, Executive Director</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS: One more thing&hellip; Be sure to watch ABC Family television this month for a very special announcement about National Bullying Prevention Month from Keegan Allen of the hit show &ldquo;Pretty Little Liars.&rdquo; Disney is a great supporter of bullying prevention and we can&rsquo;t thank them enough.
