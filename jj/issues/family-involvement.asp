<p>Research often cites the need for  greater family involvement in the juvenile justice system. <br />
Most parents care deeply about their  children and are at a loss about what to do. They may be frightened,  overwhelmed and confused by the court language and procedure. They may feel  blamed and shamed because their child is in trouble with the law. </p>
<p>There are no user friendly guides for  parents about what they need to do, whom they need to see, or what information  needs to go to court. Many parents do not even know that they can request a  public defender. They may also not realize that the public defender is  representing their child, and not them, or that public defenders have very  little time to spend with them prior to their court appearance.</p>
<p>In many cases, parents may arrive at  court at the appointed time and their case may not be heard until hours later.  Because of this, they may fear that they will lose their job and they may lose  some salary. Parents may also be unable to read the court documents, or they  have such significant personal health or family and life issues that they are  unable to participate, let alone advocate for their child. </p>
<p>The family backgrounds of youth in the  juvenile justice system may be varied and complex, but the need remains to reach  out to family members who can be a powerful force for positive change. Despite  the existing barriers to parental involvement in the juvenile justice system,  parents should be informed of their youth&rsquo;s educational rights in school,  juvenile court, and out-of-home correctional settings.</p>
