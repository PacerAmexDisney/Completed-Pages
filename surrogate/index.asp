<div class="alertBox">
<h2>Online Surrogate Training</h2>
<p>Surrogate parents play an important  role in a child's education. The   surrogate parent is an advocate for the  student. The more surrogate   parents know and the more comfortable they are with  the special   education process and procedures, the more effective they will be  in   the role of surrogate parent. </p>
<p>This training module is a guide for  training surrogate parents.   It includes information on the laws and procedures  for representing a   child in the special education process. </p>

<p>
Students with disabilities who are under state guardianship, or whose parents are unknown or otherwise unavailable, may be represented by surrogate parents trained to assist them through the education process. In addition, Minnesota law allows parents to request that a surrogate parent be named to represent their child. For children with disabilities, the role of the surrogate parent is especially important since the individual who is appointed as surrogate parent participates in IEP (Individualized Education Program) meetings to ensure the child obtains an appropriate education. Surrogate parents need to have access to information, training, and support so that they may develop the knowledge, skills, and confidence necessary to advocate effectively for children with disabilities.
</p>
<p>
PACER's surrogate parent project reaches out to surrogate parents, potential surrogate parents, and foster parents from across the state to assist their advocacy efforts. Foster parents are included in the project as they represent the largest group of potential surrogate parents. The project also serves school and county personnel who have questions about the surrogate provisions in the law.
