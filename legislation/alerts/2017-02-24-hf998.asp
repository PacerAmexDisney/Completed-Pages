<td><h1 align="center"><span style="color:red;">Action Alert:</span> Call today! Ask your Member of Congress to Oppose American Health Care Act</h1>
		<p>In the coming days, the U.S. House of Representatives may be voting on the American Health Care Act (AHCA). <strong>This bill would dangerously impact healthcare for children and adults with disabilities by removing protections for individuals with preexisting conditions and changing the structure of Medicaid. </strong></p>
		<p>Call your Representative today and ask them to oppose the AHCA and amendments that would jeopardize services for adults and children with disabilities by:</p>
		<ul>
			<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><strong>Eliminating protections for preexisting conditions, </strong>which could result in higher insurance premiums and less services for people with disabilities and special health care needs<strong> </strong></li>
			<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><strong>Reducing Medicaid funding to states</strong>, straining budgets used to provide health services to children with disabilities under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act</li>
			<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><strong>Ending the coverage of key health benefits</strong> by allowing States to waive the requirement to cover key health services including preventive care.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Thanks for your help!</p>
