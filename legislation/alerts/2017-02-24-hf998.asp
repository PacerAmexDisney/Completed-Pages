<meta name="description" content="We need your help today to protect Minnesota’s special education law by calling your Representatives to oppose HF 998. The House Education Innovation Policy Committee is voting on a bill tomorrow at 8:15 am (HF 998) that would require the Minnesota Department of Education to conduct an independent cost benefit analysis to evaluate the “economic and educational effects of conforming Minnesota's special education laws with minimum federal requirements.” We are extremely concerned this is a step to strip back MN’s additional protections for students with disabilities that exceed federal requirements, such as having transition planning begin at 9th grade rather than age 16 and requiring short-term objectives in the IEP." />

		<p>In the coming days, the U.S. House of Representatives may be voting on the American Health Care Act (AHCA). <strong>This bill would dangerously impact healthcare for children and adults with disabilities by removing protections for individuals with preexisting conditions and changing the structure of Medicaid. </strong></p>
		<p>Call your Representative today and ask them to oppose the AHCA and amendments that would jeopardize services for adults and children with disabilities by:</p>
		<ul>
			<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><strong>Eliminating protections for preexisting conditions, </strong>which could result in higher insurance premiums and less services for people with disabilities and special health care needs<strong> </strong></li>
			<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><strong>Reducing Medicaid funding to states</strong>, straining budgets used to provide health services to children with disabilities under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act</li>
			<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><strong>Ending the coverage of key health benefits</strong> by allowing States to waive the requirement to cover key health services including preventive care.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><a href="http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/">You can identify your House Member by clicking here.</a>&nbsp; If you know your Representative, you can call their office through the U.S. Capitol Switchboard at 202-224-3121.</p>
		<p>Thanks for your help!</p>
