<p>
Hi. This is Joe Nathan of the Minnesota Twins, asking parents to take part in Minnesota Parent Involvement Week, Sept. 14 to 20.  Kids can hit a homerun in schoolwork if parents are involved in learning. When parents are involved, kids have higher grades and better behavior. Visit the Minnesota Parent Center at PACER.org and be involved! Sponsored by the Minnesota Parent Center, PACER’s Minnesota PIRC.
