<h3>Minnesota&rsquo;s standardized test &mdash; MCa&ndash;II: Use the results to Help Your Child succeed in school</h3>
    
    <p>The Minnesota Comprehensive Assessments &ndash; Series II (MCA&ndash;IIs) are the standardized tests in reading, math, and science that public schools in Minnesota give to students. The state uses the tests to see how well schools are teaching the state academic standards and grade&ndash;level benchmarks for the standards.</p><p>
But what do these test results mean to your child and how can you use the information to help him or her? Your child&rsquo;s individual test results offer insight to how well your child is performing in these key academic areas. When your child is meeting the standards and benchmarks for Minnesota&rsquo;s public school children, you can affirm your child&rsquo;s success and progress. This helps your child stay on the right academic course through elementary and middle school. The MCA tests remain important to your child in high school, because the state uses them as part of the Minnesota requirements for high school graduation.</p><p>
The score reports from April&rsquo;s testing are sent to parents in the summer. You can help your child start out on the right foot academically when September comes by understanding the results before a new school year begins. You can be the key to that strong start. How? Read on.</p>

<h3>Terms to Know</h3>
<p><strong>Minnesota Academic Standards</strong> define what students are required to achieve within a school subject area. Each school subject has a set of academic standards in every grade level. They name the specific skills and knowledge base your child is expected to reach in school.</p>
<p><strong>Strands and Sub Strands</strong> are the subcategories that make up a content area. You may hear them referred to as objectives. For example, vocabulary expansion, comprehension, and literature are the strands that make up the content area of &quot;reading.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Benchmark</strong> is a specific skill students must learn to meet an academic standard.</p>
<p><em>Below is an example of how standards, strands and benchmarks work together:</em></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Grade</strong> &ndash; Kindergarten</li>
    <li><strong>Standard</strong> &ndash; The student will become familiar with the structure of printed material.</li>
    <li><strong>Strand</strong> &ndash; Speaking, viewing, and listening</li>
    <li><strong>Sub Strand</strong> &ndash; Viewing and listening</li>
    <li><strong>Benchmark</strong> &ndash;
		<ol>
				  <li>Follow print (words and text) from left to right and top to bottom.</li>
                        <li>Turn pages sequentially from front to back.</li>
        </ol></li>
</ul>

<h3>Understanding the report</h3> 
<p>Use the portion of the MCA report that details your child&rsquo;s performance on the test to see where your child is doing well and where academic help is needed. Pay attention to the overall math and reading scores as well as scores within each of the strands (see math score report example). For some grades, science scores are printed on another report.</p>
<h3>What do I do with this information?</h3>
<p>Make sure your child understands school is about ongoing learning and skill building, and that the MCA&ndash;II test is simply a picture of where he or she is at during the time the test is taken. It&rsquo;s important to remember that students do not pass or fail these tests. The test results show you where your child is succeeding academically and where additional support can help. You can:</p>
<h4>Use it in the classroom</h4>
<p>The sub&ndash;scores on the report point to how you child is progressing in specific content areas. This is important information for your child&rsquo;s teacher to know at the beginning of the school year. Bring the report to your child&rsquo;s first parent&ndash;teacher conference in the fall. The scores help your child&rsquo;s teacher know what particular support your child may need. Together, you and the teacher can decide which areas to address, how that will happen, and how you will communicate with each other about your child&rsquo;s progress. You can also ask the teacher to show you ways to help at home on these skills. As the year progresses, continue to use homework, grades, and tests to see how your child is progressing, and don&rsquo;t forget to check in with the teacher from time to time.</p>
<h4>Use it at Home</h4>
<p>You can find additional help for your child via the Internet. If you do not have a computer at home, you can access the internet for free through your public library or many community centers. Support your child by using the Pearson Perspectives Web site to find additional learning resources. Pearson is the developer of the MCA&ndash;II tests. The front page of the MCA report has a small box labeled &quot;Learning Locator.&quot; It can be found beneath your child&rsquo;s scores. Inside the box is a number. This number is your child&rsquo;s personal number. It is unique to your child.</p>
<p>The goal of the Learning Locator is to provide you with resources that are matched specifically with Minnesota&rsquo;s Academic Standards and your child&rsquo;s achievement level. The learning resources provide targeted practice on specific standards. This lets your child work at his or her current achievement level and move on to the next achievement level. Find the learning resources at: <a href="http://perspective.pearsonaccess.com/perspective/appmanager/mn/family">perspective.pearsonaccess.com/perspective/appmanager/mn/family</a>. Even if you don&rsquo;t have your child&rsquo;s Learning Locator number handy, you can still browse through the learning resources to find enrichment materials, additional self&ndash;study, or family&ndash;guided activities. You can search for individual resources as well.</p>
<p>You can also help improve your child&rsquo;s test performance on the MCAs by providing support at home throughout the school year. Encourage your child through conversations about his or her school work. Talk about the content in your child&rsquo;s daily curriculum, make sure your child completes homework and quiz your child before tests. Let your child know you have talked to the teacher to discuss academic progress. How can this make a difference? The connection is simple.</p>
<p>Remember, the MCA&ndash;IIs are based on the Minnesota Academic Standards. Public school districts in Minnesota choose curriculum meant to teach the state standards, so teacher&rsquo;s assignments, projects, and tests are based on the standards. When you support your child&rsquo;s day&ndash;to&ndash;day learning efforts you are helping your child learn Minnesota&rsquo;s academic standards and improve on the next MCA&ndash;II test.</p>
