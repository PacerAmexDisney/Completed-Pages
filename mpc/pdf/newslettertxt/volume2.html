		What do Minnesota&#8217;s academic standards and grade-level benchmarks mean to you and your child? When you make sure your child is meeting the standards and benchmarks for Minnesota&#8217;s public school children, you&#8217;re helping your child stay on the right academic course toward high school graduation. <br /><br />
		What are academic standards? They define what students are required to achieve within a school subject area. Each school subject has a set of academic standards in every grade level. They name the specific skills and knowledge base your child is expected to reach in school. A benchmark is a specific skill students must learn to meet an academic standard. <br /><br />
		Keeping track of the standards for each subject and every grade can be confusing, but it&#8217;s important for you to know that your child is meeting Minnesota&#8217;s academic standards each year. Why? Because meeting the state standards is part of what high school students need in order to graduate. <br /><br />
		So how can you know if your child is meeting the standards? Two simple tools are already in place and will help you understand how well your child is doing. These tools are the grades on your child&#8217;s report card, and the scores your child receives on the Minnesota Comprehensive Assessment exam.

		<em><h4>Grades</h4></em>
		<p>
		Public schools must choose curriculum based on Minnesota&#8217;s academic standards. The curriculum outlines what students are being taught and plans how to help them gain new skills and knowledge, including the standards&#8217; benchmarks. So the grades on your child&#8217;s report card reflect her ability to master the specifics of a standard&#8217;s skills. 
		</p>
		<em><h4>Minnesota Comprehensive Assessments</h4></em>
		<p>
		Another way to see if your child is learning the state standards in reading, math, writing, and science is by looking at your child&#8217;s scores on the Minnesota Comprehensive Assessment exam. This standardized test is also known as the MCA II. The test shows your child&#8217;s progress in achieving the grade-level benchmarks and the state academic standards. The score tells you if your child has reached the basic requirements for his grade level. <br /><br />
		Students begin taking the MCA-IIs in third grade. They are tested in reading, math and writing. Students must pass the MCA-II writing test in ninth grade, the MCA-II reading test in 10th grade, and the MCA-II math test in 11th grade. Students must take science tests once during third to fifth grade and in grades sixth to ninth. They take a life science test once in between 10th and 12th grade. Students must pass 
		the MCA-II reading test and the MCA-II math test in order to graduate 
		from high school.

			<h4>Stay on Course for Graduation</h4>
			<p>
			Passing the MCA-IIs is just one piece of what&#8217;s required in order to graduate from high school. In addition, all school districts require students to pass certain classes, and high schools also require students to successfully complete an overall number of course credits. A credit is a unit of measurement used to establish the value of a class taken. Students need to complete all three to graduate from high school.<br /><br />
			You can help your child stay on course to graduation by doing these things:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Be certain your child is attending class every day. </li>
				<li>Follow your child&#8217;s performance </li>
				<li>Speak to an academic counselor to find out where he or she can get help if there are academic problems. </li>
				<li>Talk to your child. Let him or her know how important the points listed above are, and communicate your belief in his or her ability to succeed. </li>
				<li>Call the MN PIRC and ask to speak to a parent advocate.</li>
			</ul>
