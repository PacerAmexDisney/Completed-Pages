		Residents of Wilder housing include disabled single adults, families, and seniors. Wilder owns or manages 12 affordable housing properties and over 100 scattered-site apartments in the greater Saint Paul, Minnesota area. All housing sites include on-site management and support services. Service packages, which vary by site, include assisting residents in developing financial, employment and living skills that will increase their chances of maintaining their housing.<br /><br />
		Many of the residents of Wilder housing face multiple challenges that can affect their ability to maintain stable housing. At Wilder, we believe that housing alone is not enough. A single mother who has trouble paying rent might need help finding a better-paying job. An elderly widower may require health monitoring, meals or housekeeping services in order to live independently. A struggling family might benefit from financial counseling or referrals to community services. Without supportive services, affordable housing is often just inexpensive, short-term shelter&#8212;a place to live until the next financial or family emergency forces a move.

		Student Experience is dedicated to providing excellent personal care attendant services to individuals with special needs. We recruit reliable, conscientious students pursuing careers in health and behavioral sciences. We have found that these students make wonderful, committed Personal Care Attendants (PCAs) because they are exploring their field of interest. They are motivated to learn through their experience with clients, and approach their positions with energy and excitement. We work with clients on medical assistance and who live within a 20 minute radius of the University of Minnesota and the St. Paul College campuses.
