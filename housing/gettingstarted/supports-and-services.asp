<h1>EXISTING SUPPORTS AND SERVICES TO HELP YOUR DAUGHTER OR SON LIVE INDEPENDENTLY</h1>
<p>A wide variety of services and supports exist to enable a person with disabilities to live independently. The philosophy of supported living is that no matter where an individual lives, services and supports can be matched to their needs. They can vary in amount, frequency, and duration. In order to access these services, you must apply for case management through your county social services department. Case management is defined as &ldquo;identifying the need for, seeking out, acquiring, authorizing, coordinating, and monitoring the delivery of services to, and protecting the rights of, persons with disabilities by an individual designated by the county board.&rdquo; Case managers are sometimes called county social workers. Not everyone is eligible for case management and certain services do not require case management</p>
<p>In order to start the process, you must ask for a MnCHOICES assessment by a certified assessor. MnCHOICES is a new single comprehensive assessment tool that uses the person-centered planning approach to help make decisions about services and supports. It includes a person-centered assessment of the health, psychological, functional, environmental, and social needs of the individual based on their needs, strengths and preferences.</p>
<p>If outside assessments by licensed practitioners are necessary, the case manager will arrange for them with your approval, or that of your son or daughter if he or she is 18 or older and not under guardianship. When you request an assessment or reassessment on behalf of your son or daughter for a Home and Community- Based Waiver, personal care services, or home care nursing, you must be visited by a long-term consultation team within 20 calendar days after the date following your request. The long-term care consultation team members will include a certified assessor, social worker, or a public health nurse. It is important to remember that the timelines stated in law are associated with the screening process. Services are generally provided to individuals with developmental disabilities or mental health who meet the county&rsquo;s eligibility criteria.</p>
<p>After the county assesses your son or daughter&rsquo;s individual needs,&nbsp; a service plan is developed with your input. Depending on what services he or she qualifies for, the plan name will differ. Common plan names are the Coordinated Services and Supports Plan and the Addendum (CSSP &amp; CSSP Addendum), Personal Care Service Plan, and Individual Family Community Support Plan &nbsp;(IFCSP). The plan is developed with your daughter or son&rsquo;s or your&nbsp; input.</p>
<p>It may be easier to apply during the high school years because counties usually provide case management and other services to ensure an uninterrupted and successful movement from school to the community. A case manager can help the family understand timelines for various funding sources. Formal supports like Respite, Personal Care Assistance (PCA) services, Private Duty Nursing services, Home Health Care services, Home and Community- Based Waiver programs, Homemaker services, In-Home Family Support Services, Housing Access Coordination, and 24-hour Emergency Assistance require you to apply for case management through your county social services division. Following the application process, disability related eligibility will determine the services you can access. The county looks at an individual&rsquo;s income level, assets, age, and if he or she is blind or has another disability.</p>
<p>Most providers must be licensed by a state&rsquo;s Department of Health or Department of Human Services. Programs have specific criteria, rules, and regulations that must be followed. Although there are many services and supports, commonly accessed services are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Personal Care Assistance (PCA) </li>
  <li>Independent Living Skills Training (ILS) </li>
  <li>Semi-Independent Living Skills (SILS) </li>
  <li>In-Home Family Support Services </li>
  <li>Supported Living Services (SLS) </li>
  <li>Respite </li>
  <li>Home Care Services </li>

To qualify for services, your son or daughter must have a county developmental disabilities social worker. The county in which your child lives will pay for the service if there is money available.
