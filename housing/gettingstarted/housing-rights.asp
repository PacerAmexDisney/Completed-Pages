  HOUSING RIGHTS</h1>
<img src="/housing/gettingstarted/images/summer-garden.jpg" width="300" height="327" alt="" class="fltright" style="padding-right:15px; background:#fff;" />
<h3>FAIR HOUSING ACT</h3>
<p>The Fair Housing Act protects people from discrimination based on disability, race, sex, religion, sexual orientation, and familial status. The Fair Housing Act covers additional protections for those with disabilities. If people:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Have a physical or mental disability (including hearing, mobility and visual impairments, chronic alcoholism, chronic mental illness, AIDS, AIDS Related Complex, or an intellectual disability) that substantially limits one or more major life activities</li>
                <li>Have a record of such a disability, or </li>
                <li>Are regarded as having such a disability </li>
        </ul>
<p>The landlord may not:</p>
<ul>
       <li>Refuse to let them make reasonable modifications to the dwelling or common use areas, at the person&rsquo;s expense that are necessary for that person to use the housing. When reasonable, the landlord may permit changes only if the person with a disability agrees to restore the property to its original condition when he or she moves. </li>
       <li>Refuse to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, if necessary, for the person with disabilities to use the housing. For example, a building with a no-pets policy must allow a visually-impaired tenant to keep a service animal. </li>
     
</ul>
<p class="moreinfo">For more information on the Fair Housing Act and resources on housing rights, legal issues, and advocacy, visit the Minnesota Department of Human Services Housing Resource Toolbox. For additional fact sheets on tenants’ rights in Minnesota, visit the <a href="http://www.lawhelpmn.org/issues/housing" target="_blank">Minnesota Legal Services Coalition</a>.</p>
<h3>HOUSING AND CIVIL RIGHTS</h3>
<p>The Minnesota Department of Human Services Disability Services Division is governed by many different laws and rules. Minnesota Department of Human Services (DHS) services are made possible through federal funding. County agencies and other providers also receive federal funds. They must follow federal civil rights requirements, an equal opportunity policy and a procedure for handling complaints. As recipients of federal funds, they must treat all applicants and clients fairly.</p>
<h3>STATUTES, LAWS, RULES, LICENSING</h3>
<p>Programs that are directly licensed under the Minnesota Department of Human Services (DHS) must follow enforced state standards that have been adopted to protect the health, safety, rights, and well-being of children and vulnerable adults. Programs serving people with developmental disabilities are required to be licensed under Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 245A and the new Chapter 245D. 245D is the umbrella standard for many of Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) waivers.</p>
<p>New licensing standards were passed by the 2013 Minnesota Legislature under the new 245D, and became effective January 1, 2014. The change is part of a larger Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) Waiver Provider Standards initiative to improve the dignity, health and independence of the people that are served. They were necessary in order for Minnesota to be federally compliant and provide consistent administration of licensing requirements.</p>
<p>Although regulations governing the different types of programs vary, the duties of licensors are similar. Minnesota Department of Human Services (DHS) responsibilities include: Inspecting new and existing programs, monitoring compliance, providing technical assistance, conducting investigations of alleged licensing violations, issuing correction orders if appropriate.</p>

<h3>245D RULES AND REQUIREMENTS</h3>
  <p>Chapter 245D of the Minnesota Statute provides the rules and requirements for Home and Community-Based services, the services that enable your son or daughter to live in the most integrated setting in the housing option of their choice. There have been major changes to the law and licensing which include changes to the assessment, eligibility and planning process, rate setting and housing services and supports. The changes were also needed to provide more consistent administration across all HCBS services in Minnesota.</p>

<h3>CONCLUSION </h3>
<p>This guidebook was written to help you begin to explore housing options for your son or daughter. It is beneficial to know about the wide array of possibilities. Planning ahead will provide more options for ensuring your son or daughter has the chance to achieve his or her long-term vision. Limited funding availability of supports, services, and affordable housing will affect your options. It takes time to develop a person-centered plan and pull its components together to implement it. There are often bumps in the road, and your plan will need to be flexible. With your commitment and careful planning, you can help pave the way for your son or daughter to live in the housing option and community of his or her choice.</p>
