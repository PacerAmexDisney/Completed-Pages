<p>
A young child who cannot speak may use a communication device to express his or her needs in a preschool class. A young adult with vision impairment may use computer screen reading software program to continue employment. A junior high student with a physical disability may use the computer, instead of a paper and pencil, to complete math homework. Many people with varied disabilities use technology to enhance learning, work, and independence. 
</p>
<p>
Technology for individuals with disabilities is also known as assistive technology, and it helps people with disabilities reach their full potential. Through increased independence and productivity, people with disabilities can be physically, socially, academically, recreationally, and vocationally integrated into the community.  
</p>
<p>
Whether it is a common tool, a customized device, or a product system, 
technology can increase, maintain or improve functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities. Technology helps people get and keep jobs, and it allows people to enjoy greater participation in the community. People with disabilities who use technology discover how much it enhances the overall quality of their life; they see new possibilities and experience more of what life has to offer. 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
A formal, legal definition of assistive technology was first published in the Technology-Related Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities Act of 1988 (The Tech Act). This act was amended in 1994; in 1998, it was repealed and replaced with the Assistive Technology Act of 1998 ("AT Act"). Throughout this history, the original definition of assistive technology remained consistent. This same definition was used in the Access Board's 
Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Standards, developed as required by 1998 amendments to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.<br />

PACER Center's <a href="../../../stc/index.asp">Simon Technology Center </a>(STC) is dedicated to making the benefits of technology more accessible to children and adults with disabilities. Through a collaborated effort involving parents, professionals, and consumers, the STC can provide numerous services for your family, as well as resources and informative answers to your questions. Since 1987, the Simon Technology Center has helped many children and adults, with a variety of disabilities, use assistive technology to enhance learning, work and independence.
