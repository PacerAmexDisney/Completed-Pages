<h2 class="nounderline"><a name="maincontent">USA</a></h2>
<p>
Before 1975 in the United States, children with disabilities had no federal right to a public education. To remedy the fact that one million children with disabilities were totally excluded from public education, the United States Congress passed the first Education for All Handicapped Children Act in 1975.
</p>
<p>
That law, now called the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA 2004), is the basis of a special education system that serves more than 6.7 million children with disabilities. With access to public education now provided, the foremost issue facing students with disabilities is the quality of that education.
</p>
<p>
Many people are concerned that our nation&#8217;s special education system is not providing students with disabilities with the education they need to be successful once they leave school. Despite promising practices and excellent programs that do exist, high dropout and unemployment rates for young adults with disabilities as a whole provide evidence that many students with disabilities are being left behind.
</p>
<p>
A 2002 report published by the President&#8217;s Commission on Excellence in Special Education found that "too few [students in special education] successfully graduate from high school or transition to full employment and postsecondary opportunities, despite provisions in IDEA providing for transition services. Parents want an education system that is results oriented and focused on the child&#8217;s needs&#8212;in school and beyond."
</p>
<p>
IDEA 2004 clearly states that the purpose of the free appropriate public education guaranteed by the law is to prepare students with disabilities for "further education, employment, and independent living." A quality education provides the foundation necessary to achieve these outcomes. 
</p>

<h3>Parent Centers</h3>
<p>
For many years, the U.S. Department of Education, as authorized by IDEA, has funded Parent Information and Training Centers (PTIs) in every state. Each state has at least one Parent Center, and states with large populations may have more. There are currently 
more than 100 Parent Centers in the United States. Parent Centers share a common mission to improve outcomes for children and youth with disabilities. Parent Center staff members are likely to be parents and siblings of children with disabilities or have disabilities themselves. "Parents Helping Parents" is the philosophy behind the work of Parent Centers.
</p>
<p>
Parent Centers authorized by IDEA help parents to better understand their children&#8217;s disabilities; train parents and professionals on special education issues, the No Child Left Behind Act, and related topics; resolve problems between families and schools or other agencies; assist families to obtain appropriate educational services for their children; and connect the families of children with disabilities to community resources that meet their needs.
