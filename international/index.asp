No matter where in the world they live, parents of children with disabilities share a common bond: they want their children to succeed, and they work with hope and commitment to make it happen. PACER Center's services are available in Minnesota and the United States. The PACER International web site is offered to international visitors as a resource of program ideas and practices that can improve the lives of children with disabilities.
</p>
<p>
PACER Center, long recognized as a leading U.S. parent advocacy organization, 
has become increasingly involved in international exchange activities focused on empowering the parents of children with disabilities in other countries. 
Although PACER has had informal global connections for many years, PACER 
recently embarked on several international initiatives as a means of improving 
the lives of children with disabilities and their families around the world. 
</p>

<h3>Exchange opportunities for parent leaders</h3>
<p>
Parents and professionals from other parts of the world often arrange to visit PACER Center when they are in the United States. Promoting information exchange among parent leaders from different countries has its roots in the parent-to-parent philosophy at the heart of PACER programs.</p>
<p>
The following topics have been popular international exchange opportunities:
<a href="strategies.asp">Parent Advocacy and Strategies</a>, the
<a href="puppets.asp">Puppet Program</a>, <a href="stc.asp">Simon Technology 
Center</a> and <a href="internships.asp">PACER Internships</a>.
