<h2 class="nounderline"><a name="maincontent">Information Technology Uses and Needs for Children and Adults with Disabilities:<br />An Indo-U.S. Partnership Conference</a></h2>
<p>
The Information Technology Uses and Needs for Children and Adults with Disabilities Indo-U.S. Partnership Conference was held December 5-6, 2006 at the Hotel Atria in Bangalore, India. The conference was funded by the Indo-U.S. Science and Technology Forum of New Delhi. The organizing agencies were the National Institute for the Mentally Handicapped (Secunderabad, India) and PACER Center (Minneapolis, U.S.). Approximately 120 participants attended the conference, including IT professionals, government agency representatives, parents, disability advocates, nongovernmental organization (NGO) representatives, and U.S. delegates. Conference sessions covered a wide range of topics, from practical applications of education software to research trends in the field of information technology for children and adults with disabilities.
</p>
<p>
Several themes emerged over the course of the conference: 1) We live in a changing world where technology plays an increasing role in the lives of all children and adults. 2) In order to effectively provide information technology (IT) solutions to children and adults with disabilities, there is a need for greater collaboration across systems and countries. 3.) Information technology for children and adults with disabilities must be based on individual needs. 4.) Financial, geographical, and attitudinal challenges must be overcome. 5.) Employment of people with disabilities within the IT sector shows promising outcomes for a more stable IT workforce.
</p>
<h3>1. Increasing Role of Technology in Today's World</h3>
<p>
Children and adults in India and the United States have increasing access to technology. Through technology such as the internet, people have increasing access to information from around the world. It is important that children and adults with disabilities are not excluded from these technological advances. Several presenters, both from the U.S. and India, discussed software programs that can help children learn or make computers more accessible to people of all ages. Hardware devices such as communication devices also exist to assist children and adults with disabilities. Although access to technology is increasing, it is important to remember that people in rural communities still face numerous barriers such as not knowing what technologies are available or more basic problems such as lack of electricity.
</p>
<h3>2. Need for Greater Collaboration</h3>
<p>
The need for increased collaboration was mentioned repeatedly throughout the conference. There are a variety of devices, software, employment programs, and research programs across India, but many of the people involved are not aware of similar projects occurring in other parts of the country. Government agencies, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), employers, businesses, disability agencies, and researchers need to share information in order to avoid duplication of efforts. Collaboration across systems can help more people with disabilities to be employed and help build an infrastructure for more large-scale manufacturing of information technology software and hardware for children and adults with disabilities. Increased Indo-U.S. partnerships of business professionals, NGOs, universities, government agencies, and IT developers can also assist both countries to learn from each other.
</p>
<h3>3. Individual Needs</h3>
<p>
A variety of speakers discussed how information technology for children and adults with disabilities is based on individual needs. When assessing how IT can benefit a person, their individual skills, abilities, and needs must be considered. While children and adults within the same disability category (i.e., physical, vision, learning, etc.) may have similar needs, it is still important to look at the unique functionality of each individual and the environment in which they live. Using a universal design concept will allow products to be accessible to a wide range of users while eliminating the need for individual adaptations.
</p>
<h3>4. Financial, Geographical, and Attitudinal Challenges</h3>
<p>
Numerous challenges exist to providing comprehensive information technology to children and adults with disabilities in India. Most presenters seemed to agree that some type of public-private partnership would be needed in order to fund the research, development, and dissemination of needed software and hardware. The resulting products will need to be affordable to people both in India and the U.S. Additionally, there is a large gap in access to technology based on whether one is located in a city or rural area. The size and landscape of India prevents information technology from reaching all Indian citizens. There are also still attitudinal challenges that need to be addressed. Children and adults with disabilities are increasingly being included in school, employment, and other community settings, but attitudinal barriers still exist that prevent them from being fully integrated into society.
</p>
<h3>5. Employment of People with Disabilities within the IT Sector</h3>
<p>
The stability of people with disabilities in any workforce is appealing to the IT corporate community, which is faced with rising turnover rates. Large IT corporations have found that providing specialized training, eliminating attitude barriers, and modifying the workplace environment can result in efficient employees who will be cost effective. Corporate employment offers another target for IT development in India and the U.S.
</p>
<p>
At the close of the conference, four groups were convened to develop recommendations for next steps in the areas of IT development, employment, national policy, and education infrastructure and resources. A separate action plan will be developed, but a summary of these recommendations is below:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Form bi-national task forces based on priorities identified at the conference.</li>
	<li>Form a coordinating national body with representation from foundations, disability groups, IT professionals, families, and government agencies to ensure that children and adults with disabilities in India, regardless of location or disability category, have access to information related to the development, selection, acquisition and use of accessible technology.</li>
	<li>Establish model assistive technology centers at local, regional, and national levels for the dissemination of IT resources and devices.</li>
	<li>Identify existing available resources through the establishment of regional and national databases and make use of them wherever possible.</li>
	<li>Advocate for policy development related to accessible technology and disability in the education and employment sectors.</li>
	<li>Form partnerships with the IT sector to increase accessible design, create job opportunities for people with disabilities, and encourage research and development of assistive IT. </li>
	<li>Utilize Indo-U.S. partnerships to continue capacity building </li>
</ul>
